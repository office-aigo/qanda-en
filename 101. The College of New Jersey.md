Students should visit not only TCNJ but also the surrounding area, such as Princeton and Route 1.

## Do you track demonstrated interest as part of your overall admissions process?

About 33% of applicants submitted test scores and within those applicants, 74% of those were accepted. 

## How does TCNJ determine which applicants to accept, waitlist, or deny?
They use demonstrated interest to help decide who to admit and it improves their overall yields. They may look at a student who has demonstrated a stronger interest in TCNJ versus one who has never visited, contacted them, or opened their portal. 

## What are some things that TCNJ looks for when reviewing an applicant's transcript?
Academic rigor, holding longevity in the four core areas, and succeeding in those classes. However, take the classes that matter to the student and that they want to pursue.

They read an essay about a student who overcame homelessness and adversity in a foreign language that was well-written and moving. The advice given is to write about something that is personal, unique, and important to the student, and to show their personality in the essay.

## What advice does Christina give to students about their essays?
Christina advises students to make their essays personal and not talk about anyone else in their essay. She suggests that students focus on who they are as a person and what shaped them to be that way. She also emphasizes that the essay is the most colorful piece of the application process and provides insights into students' personalities.

## What types of extracurricular activities are admissions counselors looking for on the activity sheet of a college application?
Admissions counselors are looking for any involvement a student may have outside of the classroom, such as holding a job, volunteering, playing sports, holding a leadership role, and starting a non-profit organization.

Students who need accommodations or a little extra help can work with ARC, which is an excellent resource, according to Christina.

## What are Christina's top three pieces of advice for students and their parents who are getting ready for the college admissions process?
