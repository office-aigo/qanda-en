## Do you recalculate a student's GPA or use the high school's GPA for admission? What do you look for in a student's academic record?

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class?

They use communication tools such as call campaigns and email correspondence to reach out to students. 

## What does BU look for beyond the general essay and anything else that's in the overall application in their supplemental essays?
