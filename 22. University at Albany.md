## Who is the guest speaker in this episode?
Danielle Heft, an admissions counselor at the University at Albany.

## How did Danielle end up in her position as an admissions counselor?
Danielle went to the University at Albany for both her bachelor's degree and eventually her master's degree as well. She had a growing interest in getting into the helping profession and eventually discovered higher education. She worked in a couple different offices on the campus and as she got to the end of her graduate program, she really learned and took on a great interest in the field of admissions. Her senior thesis in her master's program was actually about college admissions. A couple of months went along and there was an opening at the University at Albany Office of Undergraduate Admissions for a counselor position and she applied for it and got the job.

## What are some reasons that make the University at Albany appealing to students?
According to Danielle, the University at Albany is in a prime location, situated in the capital of New York with access to just so much when it comes to opportunities outside of the classroom such as internships, part-time job opportunities, and research experiences. The university is part of the SUNY system, which is the system of public higher education within New York State. UAlbany has about 180,000 alumni worldwide which is great for networking. UAlbany has about 50 undergraduate majors and 70 undergraduate minors and is continuously growing each year. The university is also strong in the liberal arts and sciences and is a research one institution.

## What is the student demographic makeup at UAlbany?
UAlbany has been recognized as the most diverse campus within the SUNY system. Diversity goes beyond what you can see on the outside, right? So it's where students come from, what their background is, maybe what their beliefs are religiously and culturally. UAlbany is really a nice melting pot of students from all across the state. We have about 13,000 undergraduate students and about 4,000 graduate students. So we are considered a medium-sized or a mid-sized university. So around hovering 17,000 in total. They also draw a lot of students internationally.

## How many applications do they receive a year at UAlbany?
UAlbany receives about 20,000 applications per year and their incoming first-year and transfer class is about 2,800 students.

## Can you walk us through the process of how applications are evaluated at UAlbany?
Applications at UAlbany are evaluated by a team of people representing different regions. The team consists of admissions counselors like Danielle. Danielle works with students in the greater capital region as well as the mid Hudson Valley area. They typically start reviewing applications in November, beginning with early action, and then go all the way up through March as they review regular admission applications. They use a holistic review process and consider a variety of factors when making admission decisions such as academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, essays, and letters of recommendation.

## How do admissions counselors at the University at Albany typically read applications?
Admissions counselors at the University at Albany typically read applications in the areas where they oversee recruitment. Each application may have anywhere from one to two reviewers depending on the student's application.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class in terms of GPA and test scores?
The mid 50th percent of accepted students have GPAs ranging from an 89 to a 95 on a 100 scale, which translates to around a 3.4 to a 3.8 on a 4.0 scale. For testing purposes, the mid-range of students that submitted test scores is usually around 1150 to 1310 for SATs and around a 23 to 29 for the ACT.

## Do admissions counselors at the University at Albany use the student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcript or do they recalculate the GPA using their own calculations? How do they evaluate a student's academic record?
Admissions counselors at the University at Albany use a new adjusted GPA formula that was developed around the fall 2021 admission cycle for students from any high school inside of New York state. They mostly use this adjusted GPA to determine whether a student is admissible or not. They look for an upward trend in a studentâ€™s academic record to evaluate their application.

## What can prospective students do to increase their chances of being admitted if they fall a little below the current freshman class's average?
Demonstrated interest is key in the process. Students can take that extra step to show dedication to the college. They can also be transparent with admissions counselors about their academic struggles and show how they have taken steps to overcome these obstacles.

## What are the benefits of applying early action to the University at Albany?
Applying early action guarantees a student an admissions decision by January 1st. Students who are admitted early action are eligible for additional perks, such as scholarships. The University at Albany also has some other programs for first-year students, such as the Pillars program.

## How does being test optional influence merit scholarships or financial aid at the University at Albany?
Being test optional has created a lot of equity when it comes to determining merit scholarships. Prior to becoming test optional, merit scholarship was based off of the student's GPA and test scores. Now, being test blind at the University at Albany helps level out the playing field and opens up doors for a lot more equity for students to be able to receive more merit scholarships not based off of the SAT or ACT scores.

## Have colleges been seeing a shift in the recent adoption of test optional policies and how will it impact college admissions? 
Yes, colleges are seeing a lot of students choosing not to submit their SAT or ACT scores due to concerns about negatively impacting their admissions decision. The impact on college admissions will depend on individualized decisions made by students, families, and guidance counselors. Some colleges, such as SUNY, may look into extending their test optional policy permanently.

## How important are a student's senior year courses and grades? Why would a college want to see mid-year grades? 
Senior year courses and grades are important as they demonstrate a student's continued challenge and growth. Colleges may want to see mid-year grades if a student applies for early action and additional coursework is needed to make an admissions decision. Colleges may also defer a student's application until mid-year grades are available.

## What kind of college essays catch an admissions officer's attention? 
College essays that tell a story and reveal something unique about the student catch an admissions officer's attention. Essays that explore personal initiatives, such as starting a business during COVID, or personal experiences, such as immigrating from a different country, can help a student stand out.

## What qualities do colleges look for in a student's activity sheet? 
Colleges prefer quality over quantity in a student's activity sheet. They would rather see a student put 100% into one or two activities than 50% into several. Colleges also prefer to see that a student continues their involvement in extracurriculars and takes advantage of student organizations and leadership activities in college.

## What services does UAlbany offer students who had an IEP or 504 plan in high school? 
UAlbany has a Disability Resource Center that offers individualized support for students who had an IEP or 504 plan in high school. Students are not required to disclose their plan during the admissions process, but can do so if it will help the college understand them better. The Disability Resource Center helps students navigate receiving accommodations, such as more time on exams or communicating with professors.

## What advice do you have for prospective student athletes in terms of making their intentions to play known? 
Prospective student athletes should make connections with coaches early on, such as in their sophomore or junior year. They can reach out to coaches via email or phone using the contact information provided on the athletics website. UAlbany also has recruiting forums that students can fill out to increase their name recognition and make connections with coaches.

## What are the top three pieces of advice you would give to students and parents preparing for the college process?
The top three pieces of advice are: 1) Remember that this is the student's process and they should have an equal say in decisions; 2) Start the process early and make connections with coaches and colleges; and 3) Be genuine and tell a unique story in essays and activities to help stand out in the admissions process.
