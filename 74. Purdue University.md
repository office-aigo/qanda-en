## What makes Purdue University appealing to students who want to apply and attend?
Purdue University offers a breadth of opportunity with 180 majors, including non-engineering programs. The university has a lot of cool things happening, such as a new music major in the College of Liberal Arts, fermentation sciences major in the College of Agriculture, small and collaborative business school in the Cranert School of Management, and a professional flight major with its own airport. The university is innovative, with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math. The campus has Midwest hospitality, and the university has a spirit of camaraderie.

## What new and exciting things are happening at Purdue University?
Purdue University is getting a new president, Meng Chang, in January 2023 after 10 years under the current president, Mitch Daniels. USC and UCLA are joining the Big Ten, which has an academic collaborative as well as an athletic collaborative. Purdue is completely renovating a building into a brand new data science building, has a $75 million research and testing agreement with Rolls-Royce, and a $73 million investment for a new propulsion lab. A new district on campus, the aerospace district, is being developed, and a brand new building is being built for students in the bands and orchestras department.

## How many applications does Megan Dorton review a year, and does she represent a specific region?
Megan Dorton does not provide a specific number of applications she reviews a year, but she notes that Purdue University receives about 55,000-60,000 applications a year. She does not represent a specific region, as Purdue University has a national and international reach.

## How does your office handle reviewing applications?
Purdue does not read applications specifically by geographic territory, but by academic college. For example, the College of Science has a team to read College of Science applications, and a subset of people read Computer Science. Competitive majors are segmented by geography to help with a cleaner comparison of the applicant pool.

## What is the average profile for your current freshman class?
For the class of 2021, it was Purdue's largest incoming class with 10,191 students. The middle 50% GPA was a 3.5 to a 3.9, the SAT was 1190 to 1410, and the ACT was 26 to 33. 58% were male, and 42% were female.

## Does Purdue use the student's GPA from their transcript?
We do not use the number as part of our review process because we allow students to self-report their high school courses and grades in the Common App. What we focus on is the courses the student has taken, the grades the student earned in those courses, and the context in which they took their coursework. 

## What are the different ways that a student can apply to Purdue, and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other?
Purdue has two ways for students to apply: early action and regular decision. Early action is not binding and gives students the highest likelihood for admission, full consideration for merit-based scholarships, and priority application for majors like computer science, nursing, and professional flight. Students who apply by the regular decision deadline are fully considered for admission, but do not receive consideration for merit-based scholarships or the honors college.

## What are some things that students can do to demonstrate their interests, and does Purdue track such things?
Purdue does not use demonstrated interest in its review of applications, but there are lots of things that can help a student be a strong and possibly more qualified applicant. Demonstrated interest is still tracked, and opening emails or attending events can be considered.

## What does demonstrated interest mean for Purdue University?
Demonstrated interest means that students attend campus visits, meetings in their community, college fairs when the university is in their high school, or call/email the university with questions. By being engaged in the process leading up to their application, students tend to be more informed candidates and ask the right questions, which could give them tips on what they should be thinking about when applying to the university.

## What is Purdue University's test flexible policy, and what is the number of students who applied without submitting test scores?
Purdue University is test flexible, which means that students could still be considered for admission and merit scholarships in the Honors College, even if they do not submit standardized test scores. However, the university prefers that students send test scores. About 70% of students who apply submit test scores, while about 30% do not.

## Does Purdue University accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes for course credit?
Yes, Purdue University awards credit for all of the above, including higher-level IB and some standard-level IB courses. However, when it comes to using dual enrollment to expedite the time to degree, students need to think critically about why they are taking dual enrollment. They must also ensure that the dual enrollment courses they are taking are applicable to their four-year degree plan.

## How does the application process differ for students who are homeschooled?
The application process for students who are homeschooled is no different from that of traditional students. Homeschooled students do not need to submit pages and pages of curriculum or syllabi for courses unless the courses aren't intuitive. Purdue University has a baseline set of course requirements that all students need to complete by the end of their senior year. Homeschooled students must make sure that they meet those minimum expectations and that nothing important is missed.

## How do homeschooled students fare in the admissions process at Purdue University?
Homeschooled students are admitted at the same rate as other students. There are no real concerns from the admissions office.

## How important are senior year courses and grades in the admissions process?
Senior year courses and grades are very important, especially for competitive majors. The strength of curriculum related to the available courses is evaluated. When students challenge themselves through their senior year, it is considered a positive factor in the admissions process. If a student lets off the gas in their senior year, it may be considered a negative factor.

## What advice does the admissions officer have for writing college essays?
Students should use their college essay to paint a clear picture of who they are so that admissions officers can get to know them. An impactful college essay does not have to be earth-shattering or elaborate; unique but simple essays are also effective.

## What does the admissions officer look for in letters of recommendation?
The best letters of recommendation are those that tell admissions officers things about the student that they cannot glean from other parts of the application. They should provide insights into the student's character, leadership, and work ethic. Admissions officers encourage students to think about who can write those sorts of things about them and to choose their recommenders accordingly.

## What should students do if they have a special experience with a teacher?
They should ask the teacher if he or she would be willing to write about that specific example, which will give admissions counselors more insight into who the student is as a candidate.

## What are admissions counselors looking for beyond the work a student did in the classroom?
Anything that shows the student has done things beyond the classroom. This can include family responsibilities, work the student is involved in, job shadowing, and any kind of leadership, such as mentoring.

## What are the top three pieces of advice Megan gives to students and their parents for the admissions process?
Start talking about money early, look beyond bumper sticker schools, and use college admission counselors since it's their job to help guide students and families through the process.
