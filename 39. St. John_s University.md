## What kinds of activities are colleges looking for on a student's activity sheet?
Colleges are looking for students who can contribute to their campus and who have contributed to their high school and local communities.

Any activity outside of just being a student can be included, such as part-time jobs, community service, research, or helping elderly neighbors. It is important to do things that the student enjoys, not just what they think the colleges want to see.

## What should students include on their activity sheet in their college application? 
Students should include any leadership positions, hobbies, or extracurricular activities that showcase their contribution to the campus community. They should also include jobs they have held or duties such as taking care of siblings or elderly relatives as they can provide insight into their character and responsibility. 

## Is the college essay an important part of the college application? 
Yes, the college essay is a crucial part of the college application as it allows students to showcase their personalities, character, and experiences in a unique and distinct way. It is the only part of the application that allows students to tell something that cannot be told from other pieces, so it is essential to be genuine and answer the essay prompt. 

## What are some examples of great and terrible college essays? 
Great college essays are those that reflect the student's personality and showcase unique experiences. For example, one essay from an adopted student had a funny anecdote about how her adoptive family tried to cook Chinese food and ended up ordering takeout. Another essay was about how a student's relationship with peanut butter changed when they developed peanut allergies and how they felt left out during lunchtime. Terrible college essays are those that are not genuine and can sometimes be inappropriate. For example, one student wrote about dissecting a dead bird with a plastic fork and knife.
