Three primary things that make Claremont McKenna appealing to students are being a liberal arts college with a wide range of academic offerings, a mission that prepares young people for thoughtful and productive lives and responsible leadership, and membership in the Claremont Colleges where students can select to be part of an intimate learning and living experience, but not limit themselves in that smaller size because it is surrounded by four other liberal arts colleges.

## How important are senior year courses and grades in the application process?
Senior year courses and grades are important because they are the final chapter of the high school experience. The admission committee will be curious to see what senior year courses the student is enrolled in and whether they are continuing to challenge themselves and persist with rigor. Senior year grades also show a student's potential and academic improvement.
