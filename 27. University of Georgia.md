## What does the University of Georgia offer both inside and outside of the classrooms?
The University of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia, which is recognized as one of the hippest cities in the south and has a music and art scene, creative culture, and community. Outside of Athens, the university is one of the largest public universities to require that students graduate with a form of experiential learning, where students take what they're learning in the classroom and apply it in real world ways, such as through research opportunities, travel study, and internships. The university also has about 200 majors across 18 schools and colleges and numerous ways for students to get involved through clubs and organizations. 

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at the University of Georgia?
The middle 50% ranges of the University of Georgia's academic profile include a 4.0 to 4.27 core GPA, and the university practices a whole student review, meaning that they look at everything in the student's file, but it ultimately starts with academics because they want students to be successful.

## What are the middle 50% ranges that the University of Georgia publishes on their first year profile?
The first middle 50% range refers to GPA, where the University of Georgia recalculate GPAs based on the high school's grading scale. The second middle 50% range refers to the number of advanced courses a student has taken such as advanced placement, international baccalaureate, or dual enrollment courses. The third middle 50% range refers to test scores, which is an item that the university is putting less emphasis on, but is required by the Georgia Board of Regents. The middle 50% range for ACT scores is 31 to 34, and for SAT scores, it is 1350 to 1490.

## What advice does Kelly have for a student who falls lower than the current class average?
Kelly advises students to listen to their school counselor as they are experts in the admissions process and have insight into colleges and universities. She also suggests being realistic about where a student falls compared to the middle 50% profile. While not everyone has the middle 50% range numbers, colleges and universities are going to start with academic performance. If there are dips in a student's academic performance, they should communicate this somewhere in their application. 

## Does declaring major impact admissions decisions at the University of Georgia?
No, the University of Georgia values major exploration and does not admit by major. Students can declare a major on the application, but it is okay not to list a major if they are unsure. Students can also change their major after being admitted by paying the commitment deposit. 

## What are the ways to apply to the University of Georgia?
The University of Georgia uses an early action and regular decision application process that is non-binding. Early action's deadline is October 15th, and students who apply under this process are ready to submit all parts of their application.

No, due to the volume of applicants, the university cannot conduct interviews with all prospective students. Instead, students should consider using their application as their interview.

## What should students include in their college essay?
Students should use the essay as an opportunity to share new information about themselves and to showcase what makes them unique. They should not write what they think admissions officers want to hear, but write truly about themselves.
