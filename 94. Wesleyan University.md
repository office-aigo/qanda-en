## How do colleges and universities approach the college admissions process?
Colleges and universities partner with families, but the focus is on the student being an adult who is enrolling in their community. Access to information will change as the student enrolls, so being forthcoming and following through with communication is key for students to develop necessary skills and reassure adults in their lives.
