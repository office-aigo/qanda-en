## What is the CAP?
The CAP stands for College Admissions Process Podcast, where college representatives and professionals in the field of college admissions speak and answer questions to help students and parents understand the college admissions process.

## Who is the host of the CAP?
The host of the CAP is Dr. John Durante.

## Who is the guest speaker in this episode?
The guest speaker in this episode is Tim Fields, the Senior Associate Dean of Admissions at Emory University.

## What are some unique features of Emory University?
Two distinct features of Emory that sets it apart from other universities are the city of Atlanta and its diversity. Atlanta offers many cultural and professional opportunities, and Emory has students from all 50 states and over 100 countries, with over 85 different first languages spoken.

## How many applications does Emory receive and how are they reviewed?
Emory received over 30,000 applications in the last year that were reviewed by a community-based evaluation process, where each application is read by two people, with some being reviewed by additional committees.

## What is the average profile of the incoming freshman class at Emory?
The average unweighted GPA for incoming freshman is 3.9, and Emory is test optional. The middle 50 percentile range for ACT scores is between 33 and 35, and for SAT scores is between 1470 and 1500. However, grades and courses taken are the most important factor in the application review process.

## Can you share the percentage of students admitted without submitting test scores?
Of Emory's incoming admitted class, 60% submitted some form of testing while 40% did not. Within that 40%, some students submitted AP scores, IB scores, or other additional testing that highlighted their application.
## What is the first thing you notice when evaluating a student's transcript?
The first thing we notice at Emory is the rigor of the curriculum and whether the student challenged themselves based on what was available to them in their academic offerings at their school or program.
## What is the percentage of applicants placed on a wait list, and what can students do to enhance their chances of being accepted?
Emory does not keep track of the percentage of students placed on a wait list. If a student is placed on the wait list, that student is in serious consideration, but unfortunately, they are limited in spots. To enhance chances of being accepted, students should actively put themselves on the wait list and submit additional information, such as additional grades or an additional letter expressing continued interest. It also helps to touch base with your territory manager.
## What are some things students can do to demonstrate their interest in a school?
While Emory does not track demonstrated interest, applying early decision is a clear indication that a student is serious about attending a particular school. Students can also attend information sessions, campus tours, or reach out to current students or alumni for insights.

## Does Emory track demonstrated interest?
No, Emory doesn't track demonstrated interest. However, admission officers are happy to answer questions and engage with students. 
## How can students demonstrate their interest in Emory?
Students can demonstrate their interest by highlighting their knowledge of the school and what specifically resonates with them in their supplemental essays. 
## What are the different deadlines for Emory's application process?
Emory has early decision one (November 1st), early decision two (January 1st), regular decision (January 1st), and Emory Scholars (November 15th) deadlines. 
## Does Emory take into account the high school GPA on transcripts?
Yes, Emory recalculates the GPA based on the student's sophomore, junior, and senior year grades. If the high school adds points for AP courses, Emory deducts those points. 
## Does Emory accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes for credit?
Emory accepts AP (4s or 5s), IB higher level (5s or higher), and dual enrollment classes, as long as the course is taken in addition to what is required for graduation from high school. Emory will only accept a maximum of 18 credit hours from high school.

## What is the maximum number of credit hours a student can bring in for their first year of college?
The maximum number of credit hours a student can bring in for their first year of college is 18. However, this only includes fours and fives on APs, fives on higher level IB tests, and dual enrollment credits that go beyond high school graduation requirements. Double dipping is not allowed.

## What advice does Tim have for students writing their college essays?
Tim advises students to make their essays personal, highlighting what makes them unique and differentiates them from other students in the applicant pool. Essays that make a personal connection and share something unique about the student stand out. Students should try to think of something that hasn't been expressed on their activities page or in their letters of recommendation. Tim also suggests asking family and friends what makes the student unique and incorporating those personal traits into the essay.

## What is the title of Tim's book about college admissions?
Tim's book is called "The Black Families Guide to College Admission: A conversation about education, parenting, and race."

## What are the top three pieces of advice Tim has for students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Tim's top three pieces of advice for students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process are: 1) have conversations about money early on and consider the cost when building a college list, 2) take the ACT or SAT at least once in case it is required for scholarships, and 3) make the process personal and shut out outside noise, focusing on what the student and family want and need out of the college experience.
