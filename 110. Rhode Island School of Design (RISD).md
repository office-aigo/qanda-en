## What are the three words that best describe RISD's culture according to Michael Cameron?
The three words that Michael Cameron used to describe RISD's culture are experimental, critical, and collegiate.

## What does the word "experimental" mean in the context of RISD?
The word "experimental" in the context of RISD refers to the challenges that students face in shifting their entire perception of process, what it means to make, to be a maker, and to create a problem solve.

## What does the word "critical" mean in the context of RISD?
The word "critical" in the context of RISD refers to the culture of critique that helps push students to develop as artists.

## What does the word "collegiate" mean in the context of RISD?
The word "collegiate" in the context of RISD emphasizes that RISD is a college environment where students study a rigorous liberal arts curriculum in conjunction with their studio learning.

## What is the partnership between RISD and Brown University?
The partnership between RISD and Brown University allows for open cross-registration, shared resources, and a dual degree program for students to take advantage of.

## How can students apply to the Brown-RISD dual degree program?
Students must apply to the Brown-RISD dual degree program at the time of freshman admission through the common application. They must also submit an additional written essay that explains why the program makes sense for them.

## What can you tell about the social life at RISD?
RISD has 50 clubs and organizations, collegiate sports, and students who are concerned with social equity and inclusion. Students can also participate in exhibitions and collaborations with Brown University.

## How important is the portfolio in the overall application process for RISD?
The portfolio is given the most weight in the review process, and it is important for showing a studentâ€™s commitment to making as well as their conceptual and technical skill.
 
## How does RISD assess portfolios?
RISD asks students to submit 12-20 images of their best work, most representative of themselves as an artist or designer. They then consider strength in drawing, 2D work, 3D work, risk-taking, and innovation.

## How should students approach the development of their portfolio?
Students should begin by reflecting on what influence they want to have with their art, or what area of art is most compelling to them. They should make sure that the work in their portfolio speaks to that and shows a nuanced perspective. Students should also try to develop trends and make sure that the work they select gives insight into who they are.

## How does RISD determine how many applicants to accept, waitlist, and deny?
RISD receives far more applications than seats available. They use a holistic approach to narrow down the students that they admit, looking at not only portfolios but also academic profiles and overall profiles. They have a review process that involves both staff and faculty members, and they ultimately choose to admit the strongest group. They also use ethical waitlist practices and only waitlist applicants that they want to enroll.

## How does RISD handle waitlists for admissions?
RISD does not put a ton of students on waitlists and only waitlists candidates they would be thrilled to have in the class. However, the challenge of having more applicants than spaces available is still present. 

## How many students that applied to RISD did not submit test scores?
Before the pandemic, when RISD went test optional in 2019, 20% submitted without their test scores. Today, 65% of RISD applicants apply test optional and 60% of the students that were admitted did not in fact submit test scores. 

## What areas should a student visit on and off campus if they are interested in attending RISD?
Students should visit the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab, the RISD Museum, the Fleet Library, Thayer Street, and Canal Walk. Additionally, they can take a trip down to Newport, Rhode Island. 

## Does RISD track demonstrated interest from applicants?
RISD does not track demonstrated interest because it wants to make the selection process as equitable as possible. Instead, they focus on identifying students who are innately a maker and deeply passionate about being an artist or designer. 

## What is the significance of pre-college programs, and do they increase your chances of getting into RISD?
Pre-college programs such as RISD's six-week residential program and online programming can be valuable experiences for high school students. However, they do not increase the chances of getting accepted to RISD since not everyone has the ability to participate in them.

## What are the benefits of participating in art and design programs?
Participating in art and design programs can help artists and designers to develop their skills and ideas further. It can also provide them with the opportunity to be surrounded by other artists and designers who share similar interests and push each other to do their best.

## What are the different ways a student may apply to RISD?
Students can apply through early decision or regular decision. Early decision is a binding commitment to attend RISD if admitted but also allows for better consideration in a smaller pool of candidates. Regular decision is the standard option for most applicants. RISD does not offer early action.

## What advice does Michael have for writing the college essay?
Michael advises prospective students to try not to overthink the essay and to give the admissions committee something that is not already communicated in another part of their application. He recommends not trying to be too unique or emotional just for the sake of standing out. Instead, students should use the essay to build onto their story and communicate something about themselves that is not conveyed elsewhere. The example Michael gives is that an applicant who is already deeply involved in art and design should not spend the essay talking about their love of art from a young age, since this is already evident in the rest of their application.

## What is the topic of conversation?
The topic of conversation is college admissions, specifically on how to approach the essay-writing part of the process.

## What does the conversation suggest on writing an essay?
The conversation suggests that one should have a unique and original perspective in writing an essay.

## What are the three pieces of advice given for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?

1) Stay organized and calm in organizing deadlines and schedules.
2) There is a human side to the college admissions process. Admission officers and counselors are there to help students along the way.
3) Don't be exclusively swayed by a college's name recognition, be open-minded and consider what colleges and universities are offering in terms of curriculum and faculty.
