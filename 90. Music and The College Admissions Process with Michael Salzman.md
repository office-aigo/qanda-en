## Who is Michael Salzman and what is his background in music education?
Michael Salzman is a former public school music education coordinator and an adjunct faculty member at Hofstra University who has been teaching for 33 years. He is a past president of NISMA and has released a solo album on the tuba with high praise and critical acclaim.

## When did Michael Salzman realize he had a passion for music and what did he do to cultivate that interest?
Michael Salzman realized he had a passion for music at an early age before leaving elementary school. His parents saw how music was positively affecting him and were supportive of his interest. He took private lessons from a great teacher and played in every musical group in school as well as a youth orchestra outside of school, which was a powerful influence on him.

## What are the different ways that music would be part of a student's college admissions process?
There are four groups of students for whom music would be a part of their college admissions process. These include students who are passionate about music and want to major in music performance, students who are equally as passionate about music and see themselves as music educators, students who love music but don't necessarily want to be a professional musician or music teacher, and students who want to use their musical proficiency to supplement their college application.

## What are the differences in the college admissions process for each group, and what should students in each category look for in a college and how should they prepare musically for their audition and application?
For music performance majors, the most important criteria should be who will be their private instructor, and the type of performing experiences that will be available to them. For music education majors, they should also look for great private instruction and music programs that provide experience working with young people. For the third group, they should look for a college where they can continue to participate in music but also have a strong program in another area of study they're interested in. For the fourth group, they should focus on supplementing their application with their musical proficiency and ensuring their application is well-rounded.

## What factors should music education majors consider when choosing a college?
Music education majors should consider the quality of the music education program, the percentage of students getting jobs after graduation, the percentage of students graduating in four years, whether or not the school is located in the state where they want to teach, and what performing opportunities are available. 

## What should a student who wants to continue to play their instrument while majoring in another subject look for in a college?
They should look for a strong liberal arts college or university that offers opportunities for non-majors to play or sing in ensembles and scholarship opportunities.  

## What should a musician who doesn't want to continue to study music but wants to include music in their application consider?
They should consider whether the school allows supplemental information, such as a portfolio or recording, to be included in their application. 

## What are the differences between attending a music conservatory and a university as a music major?
A conservatory offers an intense and rigorous program in music, with a focus on music and fewer opportunities outside of music. A university music program offers outstanding music opportunities and experiences, with more opportunities to explore broader interests. 

## What flaw does the interviewee identify with the audition process at many schools?
The interviewee identifies a dependence on Western classical music and a lack of opportunities for students from diverse musical backgrounds to showcase their talents. 

## What should students preparing for an audition for a music performance major consider?
They should be well-prepared, follow specific requirements and prepare specific pieces of music. Solos, orchestral excerpts, scales, sight reading, ear training or theory tests may be asked for. 

## What should music education majors consider if they are choosing music education as a fallback option?
They should know that music education is a rigorous program and may not afford them the opportunity to reach their full potential as a performer. 

## What should a musician who does not want to study music but wants to include music in their application consider?
They should consider including a portfolio or recording in their application and demonstrate how music has impacted them as a person.

## What can a student do if their career doesn't go the way they want it to in the future?
They can always go back and get a master's degree in education or any other field of study.

## What are the audition requirements for music education majors?
They still need to demonstrate that they are a very strong musician and will be able to provide the music programs ensembles with a first-rate performer. These students should probably prepare two or three solo pieces demonstrating a variety of musical styles. They will also have to be proficient in scales and sight-reading.

## What is the importance of a successful audition for non-music majors?
If they're successful, they may very possibly reap the benefits which are that they will get money to play or sing in their ensembles. Preparing a strong and diverse audition is certainly to their advantage.

## What is the word of caution for non-music majors preparing for their auditions?
They should do their homework and make sure that their intended major will not place requirements upon them that will be in direct conflict with the music program.

## Can students submit supplemental materials for their application and how should they do so?
Yes. They should make a recording that best represents them and their musical abilities. If it's a video recording, they should dress for a performance, find the right room, use high-quality recording equipment if they can, and make the final presentation impressive.

## What are the top three pieces of advice would Michael give a student musician and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Number one, if they're really serious about majoring in music performance, they should seek out the private teachers at the schools that interest them and go to them for a lesson. Number two, they should work really hard when preparing their audition because it is the single most important factor that the college will use to determine their acceptance into their music program. And number three, they should not use music education as a fallback in case the performing thing just doesn't work out.
