## What is The Cap?
The Cap is a college admissions process podcast that interviews college representatives and professionals in the field to provide insights and advice on every aspect of the college admissions process.

## Who is the host of The Cap?
Dr. John Durante is the host of The Cap.

## Who is the guest on the podcast?
Kate Anderson, the Assistant Director of Admissions at SUNY Oswego, is the guest on the podcast.

## What makes SUNY Oswego appealing to students?
SUNY Oswego is one of the original SUNYs and has a great mix of offering a lot due to its 6,700 undergraduates and about 1,000 graduate students, but still maintains a personalized experience due to its average class size of 24.

## How many applications does SUNY Oswego receive per year and which region does Kate Anderson represent?
SUNY Oswego receives about 14,000 applications per year and Kate Anderson represents the Long Island region, which accounts for about 17% of the student population.

## How does SUNY Oswego evaluate its applications?
SUNY Oswego uses a holistic application review process and individual counselors make decisions, but committee review is also used for applications that are not certain.

## What is the average profile of SUNY Oswego's current freshman class in terms of their GPA and test scores?
The median GPA is a 91, the median SAT score is an 1190, and the median ACT score is a 26.

## What can prospective students do if they fall below the current freshman class average?
Prospective students should remember that the averages are not cutoffs and that admissions considers individual strengths and stories. They should also provide contextual information to help put their grades in perspective.

## What can students do to demonstrate interest in a school? 
Students can attend virtual presentations, write their best essays, ask the right people for recommendation letters, aim for strong senior year performance, and take standardized tests as necessary. 

## Does leaving out test scores affect financial aid and merit scholarships at schools like Oswego that are test-optional? 
Oswego considers all applicants for merit scholarships, and students can receive the highest scholarship without submitting standardized test scores. However, the scholarship decision also depends on a student's unweighted grades in core courses, and a stronger test score can offset a lower GPA. 

## Does Oswego use a student's high school GPA or recalculate it? 
Oswego recalculates a student's GPA using unweighted grades in core courses and considers the rigor of the curriculum and grade trends. 

## How important are senior year grades? 
Senior year grades matter, and a positive change in grades or course selection can push a student from the "on the bubble" category to getting admitted. However, a significant drop in senior year performance can lead to a college rescinding an offer of admission.

## Why is it important for students to keep working hard in their senior year?
It's important for students to keep working hard in their senior year because colleges may request their grades. If a student does not keep up a reasonable level of performance, it could be tough news for them. 

## Can colleges ask for grades beyond junior year?
Yes, colleges may look at a student's courses in progress and request mid-year reports regardless of the student's grades in junior year. 

## What advice was given regarding the college essay?
The college essay should tell the story of who the student is and what makes them tick. They should not leave any questions unanswered, especially if there was a dip in grades. Students should try to hook their reader with a memorable story and not end with a quote or cliche. 

## What is the significance of a student's activity sheet?
Colleges are interested in how students use their time beyond the work they completed in class. Students should be involved in things they are passionate about and not necessarily try to be involved in everything. The activity sheet can be an important proxy for what a student may be interested in college.

## What advice does the speaker have for students whose activities were canceled due to COVID-19?
The speaker advises students to think about the activities they were planning to do and to come up with alternative ways to showcase their skills and interests. Instead of participating in an internship that was canceled, for example, students could build a computer or help their elderly neighbor walk their dog. These activities show resourcefulness and turning a negative situation into a positive one.

## What advice does the speaker have for prospective student athletes who want to play sports in college?
The speaker advises prospective student athletes to research NCAA rules and regulations, take standardized tests when necessary, and to reach out to the coaches of the schools they are interested in. While D1 and D2 schools have blackout periods during which coaches cannot be contacted, D3 schools allow for more open communication. The speaker also suggests creating a highlight reel and sharing game schedules with coaches.

## What are the three (or four) top pieces of advice the speaker has for students and parents preparing for the college process?
The speaker suggests the following: 
1. Cast a wide net when researching schools and colleges.
2. Trust your gut when deciding which schools to apply to and attend.
3. Try to have fun with the college selection process and not get bogged down by stress and pressure.
4. (optional) Don't worry too much about cost in the beginning because it is difficult to know how much it will cost until later in the process.
