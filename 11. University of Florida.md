## Should a student apply if they fall a little lower than the middle 50% of the current freshman class average?

## What scholarships does the University of Florida offer?
They offer three tiers of out-of-state scholarships and three tiers of scholarships for students who would be paying residential, and there is no separate application for them.

## Is there a metric used to quantify the activities students have participated in?
The admissions team looks at the student's full high school academic record, the curriculum that the school offers, the core academic subjects, honors classes, and AP classes. They also look at the overall engagement of the student outside of the classroom like community service, sports team, student government, part-time job, etc.

## How do you determine which activities are more important than others in the admissions process? 
It is a holistic process that takes into account both quantitative (numbers) and qualitative factors. The breadth and depth of a student's activities are considered. There is no specific metric for the number of activities, and the context of a student's experience during high school is important.

## How many people review the applications and what is the process like? 
Admissions staff, including admissions officers, assistant directors, associate directors, and directors, review the applications multiple times. Different committees with different perspectives also review the applications.

## Is the University of Florida test optional? 
No, test scores are required as the university is governed by the State of Florida Board of Governors.

## How important is demonstrated interest in attending the University of Florida? 
While visiting the campus and engaging in summer programs are a great way to get to know the university, demonstrated interest does not impact admissions consideration. The university is here as a resource for students and families to ask questions and navigate the admissions process.

## What services does the University of Florida offer for students with IEPs or 504 plans? 
The university connects students with the Disability Resource Center to provide accommodations and support for success on campus. The university cares about the success of its students and boasts a high freshman retention and graduation rate.

## How important are a student's grades in senior year for the admissions process? 
While senior year grades do not get calculated into the admissions GPA, the anticipated schedule and rigor of a student's senior year courses are taken into consideration. Final transcripts are necessary for admissions.

## What happens if a student's grades drop in their senior year of high school?
The admission committee may call the student and rescind their offer of admission if they see a drop in grades in multiple subjects or if the student drops out of rigorous classes. 

## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents going through the college application process?
The first piece of advice is to keep different school choices organized and adhere to their deadlines. The second is to focus on finding the right fit for the student academically rather than just focusing on athletics. Third, senior year should be balanced with enjoying the culmination of all their hard work and gearing up for the best college years. 

## What is the self-reported academic record (SRAR)?
The SRAR is a third-party system used by some schools instead of accepting transcripts from counselors. Students input their academic subject, grade, and rigor taken in high school units and link it back to their application. 

Overall, Jessica, who is an admissions officer from the University of Florida, provides advice on the college admissions process, emphasizing the importance of organization and finding academic fit while also balancing senior year with enjoyment.
