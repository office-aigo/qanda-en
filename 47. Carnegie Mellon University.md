The host is Dr. John Durante, and the guest is Ben Carpenter, Assistant Director of Admissions at Carnegie Mellon University.

## What is it about Carnegie Mellon University that makes it so appealing for students to apply and attend?
Carnegie Mellon University has world-class programs in both tech and the arts, with six different academic colleges and schools, offering something for everyone. The opportunities for collaboration and interdisciplinary work on the academic side of things are paramount to the Carnegie Mellon experience.


## How many applications does Carnegie Mellon University receive a year, and how are they reviewed?
Carnegie Mellon receives around 30-35,000 applications a year, and they are read by academic college or school. They practice a holistic admission review process and review each application by a reader, looking at various factors. There are no specific minimum requirements for GPA, SAT or ACT scores, and numbers vary based on what academic college or school the reader is reading for.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Carnegie Mellon University?
The averages are on the higher end of the GPA scale, ranging from 3.75 to 4.0. However, GPA or test scores are not the most important aspect of the application, and there are no specific minimum requirements or cutoffs for any academic programs.

## Does Carnegie Mellon University use the student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcript or recalculate using their own metrics?
Carnegie Mellon University uses an unweighted GPA as provided on the student's transcript. If it is weighted, then they will unweight it. They do not consider the ninth-grade year in the GPA calculation as it is a transitional year for many students and not necessarily indicative of future success.

## What are some things a prospective student can do to enhance their application if they fall a little below the current freshman class's average?
Through the holistic admission process, falling a little below the current freshman class's average is not necessarily the end-all-be-all. Carnegie Mellon reviews applications in a holistic way, so there is no one action or factor a student can take to enhance their application but rather the overall picture is what matters.

## Should a student apply even if their grades or test scores are below the average for a particular college or school?
Yes, it is still recommended that students apply if they have the interest, even if they are a little below the average. Admissions take into consideration the overall context for each individual student, including their application and recommendations. GPA is just one of the ways students can show why they would be a good fit for a particular college or university.

## How can students apply to Carnegie Mellon University's six different schools?
Students can apply through the common application, with the option of choosing between early decision one, early decision two, and regular decision plans. Both early decision plans are binding, meaning that if a student is admitted, they are expected to enroll at Carnegie Mellon. Early admission is available for highly qualified high school juniors who have exhausted coursework at their high school. Carnegie Mellon does not offer early action.

## Do students applying to Carnegie Mellon's programs in engineering, computer science, architecture, or fine arts need to submit a portfolio or audition?
Yes, students applying to visual arts programs such as architecture, art, and design need to submit a portfolio review. Performing arts programs such as drama and music require a pre-screen and an audition review. These additional requirements are handled directly by the school that the student is applying to.

## Has the recent adoption of test optional policies impacted college admissions, and how does Carnegie Mellon view this policy shift?
Carnegie Mellon has seen a more diverse applicant pool since going test optional, but is still studying the long-term impact of this policy shift. For the upcoming fall 2023 applicant class, the university will be test optional. Students are not penalized if they choose not to submit SAT or ACT scores, but can submit them if they feel it presents their strongest application. About 60-65% of students ask to consider their scores, and the percentage of admitted students who submitted scores is in the same range.

## What is the percentage of students who opted not to submit test scores with their application and were admitted to Carnegie Mellon?
The percentage of students over the last couple of years who asked Carnegie Mellon not to consider scores is in the 35-40% range of the total applicant pool. The percentage of those students admitted is also around the same range of 35-40%.

## How important are a student's courses in progress and grades in their senior year to the admission process at Carnegie Mellon?
These are important factors in a student's overall application, but they are not the most important. Carnegie Mellon is interested in students who can demonstrate through their coursework that they are academically prepared for the school. Mid-year grades may be requested depending on the individual context of the student.

## What are some examples of college essays that really stuck with the admissions team at Carnegie Mellon?
The essays that stand out the most are from students who are their true authentic selves and can articulate why they are a good fit for Carnegie Mellon and what unique value they can bring to the community. These students exhibit pro-social motivation, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, and an interest in collaboration and interdisciplinary work and study.

## What kinds of activities beyond academics is Carnegie Mellon admissions looking for in a student's activity sheet?
They are interested in anything and everything a student is doing outside of the classroom, whether it is directly related to their high school or to other organizations. They want to know what students are passionate about and what makes them who they are.

## What advice does Carnegie Mellon have for prospective student athletes in terms of making their intentions to play known?
Students should reach out to the coaching staff of the particular sport since it is a competitive recruiting process. Athletic scholarships are not offered at Carnegie Mellon.

## What are the top three pieces of advice that Carnegie Mellon would give to a student and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
The top three pieces of advice are to not get immediately turned off or discouraged by the cost of an institution, to look for fit both ways, and to focus on the overall journey of a student's high school career, including experiences outside of the classroom.

## What should students do to make sure the school they are interested in is a good fit for them academically and personally?
Students should utilize all available resources, such as their high school counseling office or the admissions and financial aid offices of the institutions they are interested in. They should also make sure they feel they can make significant contributions to the campus and that it would be a good fit for them both academically and personally. 

## What is a good first step for students navigating the college admissions process?
A good first step is to take advantage of available resources and seek help from those who are eager to assist, such as school counseling offices or admissions and financial aid offices.
