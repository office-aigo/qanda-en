## Who is the guest on the podcast today?
The guest on the podcast is Rebecca Schmeling, who is the Senior Assistant Director of Undergraduate Admission at Emerson College.

## What is Emerson College known for?
Emerson College is known for its collaborative and creative environment, located in the heart of downtown Boston, and small class sizes. Their majors are very experiential learning focused.

## What is unique about Emerson's liberal arts curriculum, according to Rebecca?
The liberal arts courses at Emerson are called perspectives and are unique in their nature as students can choose what classes they want to take, unlike other colleges where one must take a series of prescribed courses.

## What are the different ways one can apply to Emerson, and are there advantages of applying one way over the other?
One can apply to Emerson through early action, early decision, or regular decision. There is a slightly higher admit rate for the early rounds, but it is always a holistic application review process. Students should apply early if they can since they get a break before winter break and have more time to relax. If a student's grades are improving throughout high school, they should consider applying regular decision since the university will have a chance to see their first semester of senior year grades as well.

## Which programs require a portfolio or an interview as part of the admissions process?
For comedic arts, there will need to be a sample submitted, and for media arts production majors, students should submit a creative sample. For a specialty global BFA in film art major, an additional creative sample is required. Performance-focused majors, like theater design, will require a portfolio and interview aspect, along with an extra essay for theater and theater education.

## How does the application process differ for homeschooled students?
For the most part, the application process is pretty much the same. However, homeschool students may be asked to submit their test scores, but due to COVID-19, they are not currently required to submit them. Certain things like homeschool registration number and grades are asked for instead. They also recommend submitting transcripts and letters of recommendation from outside sources if possible.
 
## What does the admissions team look for when reviewing transcripts?
The admissions team looks for instances of rigor such as AP or college courses, dual enrollment classes, and whether or not they took advantage of such opportunities. The team also looks for trends, such as improvements and struggles in grades. They also look at what was offered at the school and the studentâ€™s performance in those classes. 

## What advice does Rebecca have for students writing college essays?
She encourages students not to worry about writing about something traumatic or big, but rather, focus on something as small as a simple moment that is important to them. Students should also think about what they want the admissions team to know about them when they finish reading their essays and that the authenticity of the essay is key. They should not repeat what is already on other parts of the application, such as the activity sheet, and they should not worry about what counselors want to read but write something that is true to them.

## What extracurricular activities make a student stand out in the overall admissions process?
The admissions team looks at leadership roles, the length of time a student has been involved in an activity or organization, and whether the clubs show their passions. The team also looks for students who take initiative and do something related to their passion even if their school does not offer it. Letters of recommendation are also helpful.

## What is a great way for students to find additional information that may not have come through in their application?
Getting a letter of recommendation is a great way to find out more information. Students can be strategic in choosing who they ask to write their letter of recommendation as it can help them stand out.
## What is the importance of taking initiative when pursuing a certain major like film?
Taking initiative and working outside of school to pursue a certain major can show the college that the student is genuinely interested in pursuing it as a major and potentially as a career.
## Does Emerson offer support for students who have had an IEP while in high school?
Yes. Emerson has a Student Accessibility Services office that helps students navigate any accommodations that they need in college.
## What are three pieces of advice for students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
First, start narrowing down the list of colleges as there are hundreds to choose from. Second, start visiting colleges to get a better idea of what the student is looking for in their ideal school. Third, know that you can have a great college experience almost anywhere, and don't forget to consider the financial aid offerings at each school.
