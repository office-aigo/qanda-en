About 89% of the students that Ohio State University admits fall within the top 25% of their class, but the admissions process takes into consideration the context of the student's academic performance. Ohio State University has gone test-optional and focuses more on the transcript and relevant academic information.

## How does Ohio State evaluate applicants’ academic performance?
Ohio State looks at whether applicants have taken challenging courses at their high school and received mostly A’s and B’s in those courses. They want students who have taken more than the minimum required credits, and those who are challenging themselves with honors or Advanced Placement (AP) classes and more science classes.
## What are the average ACT or SAT test scores that Ohio State expects for its applicants?
Ohio State previously reported an average ACT score of 29 and an average SAT score of 1330. However, since the school went Test Optional two years ago, the averages have changed. The school now accepts candidates who don’t submit test scores, but the scores are still part of the holistic review process.
## What advice does Ohio State offer applicants who fall below the average in terms of test scores?
It depends on the individual case, but Ohio State leaves it up to the student to decide whether or not to submit their test score as part of the holistic admissions review process. If an applicant believes that their lower test score still represents them academically, it’s perfectly acceptable to submit it. Ohio State ensures its holistic review assesses more than just test scores.
## Should applicants declare a major or go undecided?
Ohio State requires applicants to select a major when applying, but the school also encourages students to be flexible and open-minded. Students can change their majors within Ohio State for free, so that flexibility may allow students to tailor their major to their interests and passions.

No, they only have to choose a major, but can indicate a pre-professional interest if they have one.

## Are on-site interviews conducted for Ohio State admissions?
No, Ohio State does not conduct interviews as part of their admissions requirements, even for deferred or waitlisted students.

## What are some examples of college essays that really stuck with the admissions officer?
Essays that showed self-reflection, self-awareness, and a clear vision for who the student is and who they want to become were particularly impactful. Common themes in a student's involvement can also be revealing. Sports injury stories, despite being a common prompt, can also be impactful when the student reflects on their identity beyond being an athlete.

## What role does the essay play in the college application process?
The essay is an opportunity for students to showcase their personality and shine through, in order for admissions officers to determine if they are a fit for the university. 

## What is the value of a teacher letter of recommendation in the application process?
Teacher letters of recommendation are valuable if they shed light on a different part of the student that is not already shared on the application. They are helpful in filling in gaps in the applicant’s story that are not captured in the essay or activities list. 

## What advice is given for students when asking teachers for letters of recommendation?
Students are advised to advocate for themselves and ask teachers to elaborate on specific situations that have not been documented on their activity sheet or elsewhere in the application process. 

## What is the holistic approach in the application process?
The holistic approach looks at the total application, including grades, transcript, and co-curricular activities. One grade does not define a student and it is important to look at the entire four years of high school and beyond to determine the fit for the university. 

## What is the importance of admitting weaknesses and asking for help in the college application process?
Admitting weaknesses and asking for help is a strength and an important skill for college. Students will inevitably face challenges in college and it is important to be able to recover from setbacks. This skill can be developed in high school by overcoming obstacles and turning things around.

## Can you talk about the process for students aspiring to be college athletes at Ohio State?
Students aspiring to be college athletes at Ohio State still have to go through the same holistic admissions review process as any other student. Even if they are being recruited, they still have to apply and are eligible for merit scholarships. Admissions has a liaison with athletics to honor NCAA guidelines, but the process is separate from admissions. If a student is interested in playing college sports and has not been recruited yet, they should be in touch with their high school coach or athletic director to learn about the clearing house and registration process. There is a recruit form on the Ohio State Buckeyes website for some varsity sports. Ohio State also has club sports teams and rec sports programs for students interested in athletics.
## What if a student is an outstanding musician and is interested in playing in the Ohio State marching band?
Any student can try out for the marching band and they don't have to be a music major or minor. The marching band has tryouts and hosts clinics, interest forms, and has a robust website that details out when and how to try out for the band. The marching band requires a significant time commitment, even practicing more than some athletic teams. Scholarship opportunities exist for the marching band, and the band performs at various events. If a student is not offered a spot in the marching band, they can still participate in other musical ensembles or pep bands. Highlighting musical talent on an application is a holistic criterion that Ohio State looks for.

## What are the three top pieces of advice or recommendations for students and their parents preparing for the college application process?
The first piece of advice is to take some time to reflect and include people in their life that care about them. Enjoy the process of learning about themselves and the opportunities available. The second piece of advice is to ask questions and record the answers. Don't hesitate to ask questions, whether it's to oneself, on a school's website, or to someone like an admissions counselor. Recording answers in a system that works for them is essential. The last piece of advice is to try to visit a school, but if it's not possible, ask the admissions counselor to connect with a current student. It's important to find the school that fits them, and speaking to a current student could provide a good feel for the school.
