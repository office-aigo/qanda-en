## How does UC Santa Barbara evaluate so many applications?

However, the university admits students from a full range of GPAs and takes into account context, such as the academic offerings available at the student's school.

## What factors does the University of California consider when reviewing a student's academic record?
The university looks at the school's offerings and the courses a student chose, analyzing whether the student challenged themselves with a rigorous schedule. The student's major is also of interest, taking into account the specific requirements of the major. If there is a dip or bump in the student's record, the university looks to the Personal Insight Questions or Academic Background section for explanation.

## What does being test-free mean for the UC system in comparison to schools that are test-optional?
Being test-free means the UC system does not consider test scores at all during the admissions process, and will not collect or use them for scholarship purposes. Even if a student sends their test scores, the UC system will ignore them. Some UC campuses may use exam scores for placement purposes after the admissions process has ended.

## How important are students' courses in progress and grades in their senior year for the UC application, and what is the university looking for when reviewing them?
The UC application only requests grades up to the end of junior year, but they do evaluate courses in progress and senior year grades if they receive them in the fall. The university looks for consistent grades throughout senior year and whether the student continued challenging themselves academically.

## How important are senior year courses and grades in the UC application process?
Senior year courses are important because they are used to assess the rigor of the applicant's course load, however, senior year grades are not computed into the GPA used for admission. But, if an applicant is accepted, the university will review the senior year transcripts and expect their performance to be at the same level as they were in their junior year.

## What are some examples of personal insight questions and what is the approach to answering them?
There are eight personal insight questions, and students must choose at least four to answer. These questions should be approached with a direct and factual style of writing, rather than a formal essay. Students should provide concrete examples to back up any adjectives they use to describe themselves. It's also advisable to use multiple drafts and not simply recycle essays written for other applications.

## What qualities beyond academic performance are universities looking for in applicants?
There is no recipe for admission, but universities are looking for passion and involvement in extracurricular activities or hobbies that demonstrate the student's character, interests and potential contributions to campus life. For example, students who are passionate about a particular activity or sport like water polo will stand out in the admissions process.

## Can you explain the importance of extracurricular activities in the college admissions process?
Extracurricular activities are important in the college admissions process, but it's not about the quantity of activities. It's about the quality and the student's passion and dedication to those activities. Participating in activities related to one's interests and exploring various areas can be valuable. Leadership and creativity in those activities also stand out. It's not necessary to start a club or have leadership positions, but students should explain their activities and their impact in detail.

## What are your top three pieces of advice for students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?

The second piece of advice is to explore extracurricular activities related to one's interests and to dedicate time and effort to those activities. Finally, seeking help and utilizing resources early and often, such as tutoring and study centers, can help students adjust to the academic demands of university level learning.

## What should students do to explore what environments they get fired up in?

## Should students succumb to the pressure to go with the big name or ranking of a college?
No, students should not succumb to the pressure to go with the big name or ranking of a college. They should consider what college might be better suited for them. 

## Who should students go to for honest answers about college admissions?
Students should go to admission counselors, who are there to admit them and give honest answers. 

## Should students be wary of external sources of information about college admissions?

## Should students try to show demonstrated interest in colleges to increase their chances of admission?
It depends on the college, but many public universities do not care about demonstrated interest. Students should take a campus tour to help them decide if it's the right fit for them, but taking a tour will not give them extra weight in the admission decision. 

## What factors should students consider when choosing a college?
Students should consider whether they want to be close to home, the size of the school, and the environment, whether urban, suburban, or rural. They should take the time to reflect on what's the right fit for themselves instead of just looking at friends or rankings.
