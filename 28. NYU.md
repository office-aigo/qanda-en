## What are three top pieces of advice would Ariana give students and their parents getting ready to apply to college?
Ariana's top three pieces of advice for students and their parents getting ready to apply to college are: take some deep breaths and remember that this is your opportunity to make a decision for yourself; be organized about the different campuses and what they offer, what kind of scholarship or financial aid opportunities they might have, and what kind of deadlines they have for admission and for financial aid; and keep in mind that where students go to school is not the most important part of who they are. It is not a judgment on their value in the world and what they're going to contribute to the world.
