## How does the application process differ for applying to the Stamp School of Arts and Design at the University of Michigan compared to regular admissions? 
The first step is the same, using the Common Application to submit an application to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. If a student is applying to the Stamp School of Arts and Design, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions looks at the application to see if a student would be a strong fit for the university and the specific program they're applying to. If a student advances, the application then moves to the next section, which is being looked at by the Stamp School of Arts and Design. The portfolio is 50% of the application, and a strong portfolio is required for admission. The admissions team at the Stamp School looks at the portfolio to evaluate the student's technical skills and creativity, while considering some of the student's academic performance. Test scores aren't as important as they are for regular admissions.

## What is Taylor's advice to anyone looking at Stamps Boulevard Design or art school in general?
Taylor advises anyone looking at Stamps Boulevard Design or art school in general to connect with her on LinkedIn or email her with any questions they have. Reaching out to everybody and creating a network of people is what essentially is going to get you that information in the first place. And by reaching out to students, you get to see what the student life is like. Going to campus and seeing how they interact with the environment and seeing how, do they actually, like, do they look happy? Are they enjoying themselves? Are they having fun there? These are all things that are important when it comes to picking the right place and the right college, and feeling that you found a place that makes you feel like you're at home. 
## What has Taylor learned during her academic career?
Taylor has learned that you might have a plan to go somewhere or to do something, but there are also chances that life is just like, nope, and that plan completely changes. And there are probably going to be times where you're having your ultimate highs, but you're also going to have your ultimate lows. And that shouldn't be a discouragement to you because it happens to everyone. It happened to her and some of her friends. Taking things one day at a time and step by step, and not trying to really overpack everything and make things super overwhelming for yourself, which is a lot easier said than done, is one of the most important things to making sure that you are also taking care of yourself while going through such a stressful and invigorating process.
