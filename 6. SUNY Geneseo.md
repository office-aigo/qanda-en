Yes, we do. We take the core subjects and dissect it to come up with our own GPA.

The quality of the writing, the overall look of the application, and the demonstrated interest are all important factors.

Students should not wait until they receive their admissions decision to demonstrate interest. Demonstrating interest throughout the whole process is important.

The average GPA is around 92-93. The average SAT was about 1230, and the average ACT was about 25 pre-pandemic, but the school has been test-optional for the past two cycles, so it is hard to provide valuable test score data.

## How important are senior year grades when it comes to college admissions, and can they make or break an admission decision? 
Senior year grades are important because high school is four years, not three. Admission is contingent upon completing high school at the level shown during the application process. Rescinding admission or being placed on academic probation is possible if senior year grades tank. 
## Can a unique college essay topic that isn’t traumatic or life-changing help a student to stand out in the admission process?

Check that email every single day because that's the way colleges communicate with you.
