## Who is the host of the CAP podcast?
Dr. John Durante is the host of the CAP podcast.

## Who is the guest being interviewed in this episode?
Adam Webster, the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Admissions at Carleton College, is the guest being interviewed in this episode.

## What makes Carleton College so appealing to students?
According to Webster, the student body and the faculty commitment to student success are what makes Carleton College a great place to attend. Additionally, there is a functional relationship between the staff and faculty.

## What can you tell us about life on campus at Carleton?
Carleton College is a fully residential campus with an emphasis on dorm-centered living. There is no Greek system. Northfield, Minnesota is an essential part of the student experience. The campus offers opportunities for outdoor activities, and Northfield is a great college town.

## What are some spots that visitors to Carleton College must see?
Visitors should start with the admissions office, as they are designed to be the front door to the college. The Weitz Center for Creativity and Anderson Hall of Sciences are two anchor buildings that visitors should consider exploring. The Arboretum is also a must-visit spot for those who enjoy the outdoors. 
## How do students demonstrate their interest in Carleton College?
Carleton College does not track demonstrated interest, but applicants are expected to have a working understanding of the institution. It is more important to demonstrate an understanding of Carleton or any other college that one is applying to. 
## What percentage of students admitted to Carleton did not submit test scores?
For last year's class, 53% of students admitted submitted test scores. An additional 7% shared scores after the admissions decision was made. 
## How does Carleton determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist or deny?
Carleton prioritizes reflecting a broadly diverse applicant pool by geographic location, identity, interest and aspiration. They also aim to address institutional priorities and goals, such as working with Pell eligible students. They do not use a large algorithm to guide decisions.

## Does Carleton College have any requirements for enrolling middle-income students?
Yes, Carleton College has a fixed requirement to enroll and matriculate middle-income students, currently at 30% of the student body. 

## Does Carleton have any limitations on admissions based on budgetary considerations?
Yes, there are limitations based on budgetary considerations in terms of financial aid dollars available and the number of beds on the fully residential campus. 

## What is Carleton College looking for when reviewing an applicant's transcript?
Carleton is looking for both balance and rigor across the curriculum, not just in a student's intended major. They look for core disciplines throughout all four years of high school and expect students to demonstrate a transcript that reflects their interests in potential career paths. 

## What are the different ways a student can apply to Carleton?
Carleton accepts both the QuestBridge application and the Common Application. They also have an early decision format with fixed admission dates. QuestBridge encourages more narrative sharing, while the Common Application is a shorter application. Their first early decision round is in November, and the second round is in January.

## What is the purpose of early decision rounds in the admissions process? The purpose of early decision rounds is to find a supreme match for the student rather than just a better match based on statistics. However, most students are admitted in the regular decision round which takes place until mid-March and gives families time to make decisions based on financial aid awards. 
## What are some key traits of a good college essay? A good college essay should have a believable voice and be authentic. It should explore an idea or claim while acknowledging its limits and should be polished and edited. Good essays are self-aware and can be playful with the form if the writer feels comfortable enough to do so. 
## What makes a student stand out in the overall admissions process? Congruence between the elements of an application is important in determining whether or not a student will stand out in the admissions process. The admissions team looks for a believable person who is exploring their interests and whose activities align with their transcripts.

## What is Carleton looking for in student applications?
They are looking for students who understand the value of what they are doing and can articulate what it has come to mean for them. This may look different for each student, as some may have a lot of formal leadership experience while others may have a variety of experiences or responsibilities at home. The most important thing is that students show intentionality and understanding in what they do, rather than just doing something to put it on their college application.
 
## What is Carleton's approach to students with disabilities or who had an IEP in high school? 
Carleton has an Office of Accessibility Resources to provide support to students with a variety of needs, and they encourage students to seek out this resource if they require any kind of accommodations or assistance. Carleton also has a personalized onboarding process that lasts three months, during which they work closely with incoming students to make sure that their needs are being met and they are able to transition smoothly into college life. They also consider factors such as roommate matching and advisor load to ensure a cohesive and supportive environment. 

## How does Carleton's trimester system work?
Carleton is unique for their commitment to a trimester academic calendar, meaning that students take only three classes at a time over a 10-week term, three times per year. This can be contrasted with the traditional semester system where students take four or five courses over a longer period of time, twice a year. Carleton's faculty has embraced this system and sees pedagogical value in the compressed schedule, which requires students to move quickly and deeply into material. Carleton's learning environment is known to be rigorous and paced, and they look for students who are comfortable with adjusting to this structure.

## What is the unusual rhythm that the host is referring to in the conversation?
The host is referring to the six or seven week winter break that they have every year.

## Is there a question that the host wishes to ask but didn't?
The host asked this question to Adam, who is the interviewee.

## What does Adam think is important before starting the college search?
Adam thinks it's essential to finding a sustainable and safe rhythm for talking about the college search without it becoming oppressive or overwhelming. It is a student and family partnership, and there's a way to set up a rhythm that works for everyone.

## How should parents handle the student's confiding in them and what approach should they apply?
Parents should be receptive to what their child is saying without judging or rewriting their words. The approach should be helpful for the student and not influence their anxieties.

## What is Adam's first piece of advice for students and their parents?
Adam suggests accepting the college search as a journey with multiple and valid end points where higher education in this country doesn't permit a funnel-like approach. The college search requires gut check calls and taking time to sort through them.

## When is the ideal time to start the college search, and what does it involve?
The ideal time to start the college search is giving oneself enough time to plug in intensely and take stock or reflect on where to jump back in. The search will involve research, reflection, assessment, and revision.

## What is the proactive approach for owning the college search?
Students and families should ask for help from people in the neighborhood if on the college search, their high school counselors, and letters of recommendation from their employers or teachers or coaches. Ask way in advance of a deadline.
