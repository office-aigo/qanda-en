## Who is the guest in the episode geared specifically to student athletes and their parents?
Jack Monfort, a men's lacrosse player at Yale University, is the guest in the episode.

## Could you summarize Jack's lacrosse journey?
Jack started playing lacrosse when he was four or five years old and joined a travel team at fifth and sixth grade. He didn't make it into the first choice but eventually climbed up to A team. Jack's breakout year was in eighth and ninth grade. He got some calls from coaches in ninth to 10th grade, including one from Yale's Coach Shea. After playing well in a training camp, Jack was offered a spot by Yale and he accepted.

## Did Jack play other sports besides lacrosse?
Jack stopped playing soccer for three years to focus on lacrosse as his primary sport, but he came back to soccer later, which helped him stay in shape and more versatile.

## How was Jack approached by the coaching staff at Yale?
After playing a decent game, Coach Shea called Jack's coach to ask if Jack could come to a training camp. Jack played well there and was offered a spot on the team after a revisit to the campus.

## How did Jack approach the recruitment process?
Jack wasn't a top recruited player but got more looks after committing to Yale. Looking back, he thinks he should have given himself more time to think about what school best fits him, whether that's a big school or a practice schedule.

## What helped Jack the most in getting recruited? 
Jack thinks being active helped him a lot. He was sending emails every single weekend in the summer with his information about where he's playing, what field he's gonna be on, and what time these games are. He also mentioned that it was important to have good academics and be a good person. 

## Did Jack have anyone that helped guide him through his decision process when getting recruited? 
Jack's dad was very active with him. He would help him with every email he sent. His parents were going every weekend, and they were very supportive. 

## What was Jack's overall draw to Yale, and what would he advise potential collegiate athletes to consider when trying to decide where to play? 
Jack's overall draw to Yale was the name, but under that was probably seeing how similar Coach Shea and Coach Calabrio's personalities were. He thinks it's important to want a coach that's gonna be on your side and really cares about you as a person. He suggested potential collegiate athletes consider focusing on their sport, finding a college that fits their personality, whether they want a big or small college, how are their academics and social life. 

## What would Jack say to current students in high school in terms of what it takes to go to an elite Division I university to play lacrosse? 
Jack thinks you definitely have to love your sport and you wanna perfect your craft. It's a full-time job, and if you aren't fully committed, you're really not going to enjoy playing. You really need to enjoy it. 

## What was the transition like for Jack from high school where he was a star player to then becoming a brand new student athlete at Yale University? 
It was tough for Jack to go from being the man and an all-American in high school to then playing on a college team where everyone else was also an all-American. He had to lose his ego and find his role and double down on that. He didn't see the field his freshman year. The week prior to them leaving campus, he had a tough time during a film session, but it wasn't personal.

## What challenges did Jack face as a college student-athlete at a Division One school academically?
Jack had to adjust academically because he went from a public school to one of the best academic schools in the nation. When he got to class, he was surrounded by salutatorians and valedictorians and he had to compete for grades with those students. 

## What is a typical day for a college student-athlete at a Division One school?
Jack wakes up for Lyft at 9 a.m., has usually two to three classes during the day, and then goes to practice right after. He spends most of his day enveloped in lacrosse, thinking about the next thing he has to do for the sport. 

## How does having games away from home affect a college student-athlete's schedule?
A week with an away game is mostly the same as a typical week except they have to start loosening up for practice earlier in the week because they will have to travel on Friday. They miss Friday classes, but they get a Dean's excuse for that and they catch up on their work. 

## How did Covid affect Jack's eligibility as a player, and can he play more than the traditional four years?
Covid helped Jack out personally because he took some time away from school and lacrosse. Jack can have an extra year to play, but he can't do it at Yale because of the Ivy League rule. 

## What are the top three pieces of advice that Jack would give to a parent and student-athlete who is aspiring to go through the recruitment process?
Jack's top three pieces of advice are finding confidence in yourself, enjoying the recruitment process, and knowing that it takes what it takes to succeed.
