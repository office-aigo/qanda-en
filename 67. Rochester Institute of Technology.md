## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
The top three pieces of advice for students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process are:

1. Visit virtually or in person, talk to as many people as possible, including professors and students who are really living it day to day.
2. Ask for more money. It never hurts to ask for more and to appeal your financial aid.
3. Give honest thought to what makes the best sense for the student, considering the community, academic opportunities, overall debt load in the long run, and realizing that nothing is set in stone and that students can always change their mind. College is a place that students are going to be calling home and their community for four years, or even more if they get a graduate degree.
