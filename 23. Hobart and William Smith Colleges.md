## Can you introduce yourself and how you ended up as the assistant director of admissions at Hobart and William Smith colleges? 
I have been in admissions for three years, starting as a student worker in the admissions office as a senior intern and now two years on staff full time as the assistant director of admissions. I am also an athletic liaison, an advisor for a fraternity on campus, and an assistant coach for the Hobart football team. 

## What makes Hobart and William Smith colleges appealing to students? 
There are three areas that make the college unique: location, academics, and life outside the classroom. The college is located in the Finger Lakes region in Geneva, NY, which is near many vacation destinations and known for its wine region. Academically, the school is a small liberal arts college with 68 different minors and 45 different majors, pre-professional programs, and two master's programs. The college also has a unique approach to interdisciplinary learning with eight goals that need to be accomplished before graduation. Life outside the classroom is also vibrant with 13 centers on campus and on-campus activities run by the campus activities board. 

## Can you tell us more about life on campus outside of the classroom? 
Life on campus outside of the classroom is vibrant with many seasonal activities such as a homecoming weekend, ice skating and live bands in the winter, and a welcome back concert in the spring semester. On-campus activities are run by the campus activities board and will be displayed in academic spaces to inform students.

## Can you tell us about the opportunities for students to stay active on and off campus?
The college has a cool Instagram account to keep students informed about events and opportunities in the community. Students can also take advantage of things in the surrounding area such as state parks, waterfalls, and lakes. There's a dock on campus where students can rent pontoon boats, kayaks, and paddle boards which they can use on the lake.

## How many applications do you typically review in a year and which regions do you represent?
I am the regional manager for Long Island, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. Within our office we typically have around 5,000 applications and our reviews are based on our assigned regions.

## Can you walk us through the process of evaluating so many applications?
Our review process is based on a buddy system where we have someone else with us for reviewing applications in our assigned regions. If there is a disagreement between us and our co-reviewer, the application may be pushed to a committee for re-review. We review applications holistically which means we evaluate the entire application from the essay, to extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, and of course, the academic record.

## What is the average profile for the current freshman class?
The current average GPA is around 3.55 with SAT scores ranging from 1180-1360 and ACT scores ranging from 27-31. Around 87% of our first-year class played a sport in high school. 60% of our students come from outside of New York State and 40% are from inside New York State.

## What advice do you have for prospective students who fall below the current freshman class average?
They can try to show an increase in grades over the years and show involvement in extracurriculars. Additionally, demonstrate a commitment to the community and school and show how they've grown since their freshman year.

## Do you recalculate a student's GPA or use the one on their transcript?
The college takes the GPA right off the transcript, but may recalculate it if they feel it is inflated or if a student transferred schools.

## What are you looking for in a student's activity sheet?
The college likes to see a commitment to the school and community, as well as a passion outside of school, such as sports or music. They want to see depth of activity, for example, consistent commitment to the same sports team or music instrument. Quality over quantity is important, but don't forget to include all activities, including part-time jobs.

## What is the importance of extracurricular activities on college applications?
Extracurricular activities are important and not to be shortchanged. Counselors can use them to understand a student's personality and interests.

## How important are a student's grades in their senior year for college admissions?
Senior grades are super important and indicate how a student will transition into college. Colleges want to see that students are continuing to challenge themselves and staying atop of what they've done over the years to continue achieving academic success.

## Does Hobart William Smith College offer support for students with disabilities?
Yes, Hobart William Smith College offers a Center for Teaching and Learning, which offers support for students with IEPs and disabilities. The center provides support for students who need extension on a paper or test, need to take a test in a different room, or need extra help in a specific topic.

## What advice does Ryan have for students aspiring to play sports in college?
Students should communicate their intentions to play and make connections with coaches or admissions officers. They should also use social media to market themselves and emphasize their values in a college athletic team.

## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?
1) Find your values in terms of what you value in a school. 2) Choose a good email address and use it for the entire process. 3) Be thorough through the process and over-communicate.

## What is the importance of having a separate email address for college applications?
Having a separate email address for college applications is beneficial for keeping track of important emails and avoiding important emails getting lost. Additionally, colleges can track student engagement with their emails and having a unique email address can show demonstrated interest. 

## How can students avoid feeling overwhelmed during the college admissions process?
Students can avoid feeling overwhelmed by choosing a night of the week to talk about the college admissions process with their families, not letting the process dominate their senior year, and finding time to enjoy the process and visit schools. 

## What advice is given for students when choosing a college?
Students are advised to find their values and preferences for the size of the school, location, and other important factors for a good fit. This should not be based on where friends are applying but what is true to themselves. 

## What is a final piece of advice for students applying to college?
The final piece of advice is to not let the college admissions process overwhelm or negatively affect academics or extracurricular activities. It is an exciting time and students should enjoy the experience.
