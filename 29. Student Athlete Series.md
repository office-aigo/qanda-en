## Who is the guest speaker for today's episode?
The guest speaker for today's episode is John Calabria, Syosset High School's Boys Varsity Lacrosse Coach.
## What is John Calabria's coaching history?
John Calabria started coaching at Sahum High School. He was a football player and didn't really play lacrosse. He was forced into playing lacrosse by his football coach. He had a lot of coaches influence him when he was in middle school and high school. He has been the head coach at Syosset for 22 years and has guided over 170 student athletes and their families through the recruitment process to 48 different colleges and universities throughout the United States from 2001 to today.
## What was John Calabria's own recruitment process like?
John Calabria dreamt of playing big-time Division I football and then in the NFL. He played lacrosse and was on the Empire State Games Team. After graduation, he got a phone call from Paul Daugherty, the head coach at Adelphi University, who offered him a scholarship to play lacrosse at Adelphi. He accepted the offer because his parents didn't have any money to send them to college. His first few years at Adelphi were tough. His coach asked him to work a lacrosse camp and he found his love for teaching and coaching. He graduated with a business administration degree but got his master's in teaching and worked as a soul studies teacher while working as a graduate assistant at Adelphi. He was offered the head coaching job at Queens College, but it was difficult to recruit players who were interested in going to Queens College.

## What was the difficulty with recruiting lacrosse players at Queens College?
You needed very intelligent players, but they were not taking anyone with a high GPA. It was very difficult to recruit, and they struggled in the first year. Because of Title IX and being the program that was struggling the most, boys lacrosse was ended at Queens College.

## How did the speaker start his coaching career at Syosset High School?
The speaker got an interview at Syosset High School with two gentlemen, Al Yannacy and Rich Collins, two legends. Two days before that, he walked into Syosset High School and handed his resume to the principal, George Schneider. George then pulled him aside and went over his resume before someone who had the job left, and he was able to get the job.

## What are the things that college coaches look for in athletes when they already know they can play?
College coaches are interested in what kind of kid the athlete is. They are looking for their character and what they are like on a day-to-day basis, their performance in the classroom, what their friends say about them, what their teachers say about them, and what their family dynamic is like. They are looking to see if the athlete will be a good fit for their program.

## What is the main concern for college coaches when recruiting student athletes?
The main concern for college coaches is ensuring that the student athlete they recruit will not negatively affect their livelihood. This means that the athlete should have good character and not create any issues for the team.

## What happens when a coach decides not to recruit a kid?
When a coach decides not to recruit a kid, it is important for the student athlete and their family to reevaluate their situation and find the right school fit. Trying to force a bad situation rarely works out and may result in the athlete transferring to another school.

## What is the NCAA Clearinghouse and what do student athletes need to do to be cleared?
The NCAA Clearinghouse is an organization that all student athletes who play in college, division one, two, three, or junior college must go through. Student athletes need to register on NCAA.org and ensure that their courses and medical clearances are approved.

## How does the conversation about scholarship money start between coaches, parents, and student athletes?
Coaches will usually ask about the financial need of the family and may offer scholarship money accordingly. However, the recruiter or advisor does not typically see the exact dollar amount of the scholarship.

## What questions does a high school coach ask families during the recruitment process? 
The high school coach would ask the family and student athlete about their personal finances and what they are looking for in an investment for the athlete's future. The next question would be how many schools are recruiting the young athlete as scholarship money is based on these two factors.

## How do scholarships work in lacrosse? 
A fully funded lacrosse program gets 12.6 full scholarships, which means everything is taken care of. There are usually one to four kids on a team that have a full 1.0 scholarship, and the other 8.6 would be dispersed throughout the rest of the team.

## Who has the final word on scholarship offers?
The head coach of the sport offers the scholarship, and they will always have the final word on the scholarship. Typically, this happens at a visit.

## What happens after the commitment is made by the student athlete to accept a scholarship offer?
Once the athlete has committed, they will sign their letter of intent. There's typically a ceremony at the high school to celebrate the commitment. The high school coach follows up with the students and family to stay connected.

## How does a high school coach develop relationships with college coaches?
The high school coach develops relationships with college coaches by getting to know them and their coaching styles. Sending a student athlete to a college makes the coach look good, which can lead to more students being sent to that college.

## Why does John like to follow up with student athletes?
John likes to follow up with student athletes because it is good for his program, and it really helps everyone involved including the kids, parents, and coaches.

## How has John built his network?
John has built his major network through the fond reputation he has with his student athletes.

## What advice does John have for parents and student athletes who aspire to play at the collegiate level?
John advises parents and student athletes to find the right school that is academically the right fit, to make sure they visit when students are on campus, and to keep geography in mind. He also advises that people should avoid rushing into a decision and to make sure they find a school where they can manage their time effectively.

## Why is it important to find the right fit when looking for the right school?
Finding the right fit is important because too often, people take it for granted and do not consider whether they want to be in an urban or suburban environment, or how far away students' schools are. It is also important to consider how a highly academic school may affect student-athletes, particularly during the pandemic.
