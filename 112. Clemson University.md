## What is the Clemson brand and why is it appealing to students?
The Clemson brand combines athletics, social experiences, and academics. It is promoted by Clemson alumni and has grown rapidly over the past few years. The realness of the Clemson family concept is also appealing to students, and once students visit campus, they see that their students are happy and they feel the energy. Clemson challenges their students to explore all areas of their academic interest within the college and encourages them to think about what they want to do instead of what they want to major in. This concept is unique to Clemson and it allows students to get a better understanding of how each major will allow them to reach their career goals. 

## What is unique about Clemson's admissions process?
Clemson has several levels of review when it comes to admissions, and the initial review is done by the associate deans and the admissions counselors. They ensure that there are no errors in the student's application file within their system. Their selection index includes the GPA, class rank, and test scores, and they review this information to ensure that it looks accurate based on the student's GPA. The purpose of this initial review is to make sure the files are accurate and to get them moved to committee review. Their main committee will review all in-state schools and any of the out-of-state schools that have a significant number of applicants.

## Does Clemson University have a selection index for reviewing applications? 
Yes, Clemson University uses a selection index for reviewing applications which includes various data points such as test scores, GPA, and class rank.

## How does the admissions process differ for student athletes? 
The admissions process itself does not differ for student athletes in that they follow the same process and they have to submit the same materials. Where the process differs for student athletes is that the coaches for the teams do the recruiting.

## Can you share the percentage of students that apply and that are ultimately admitted that did not submit their test scores? 
For early action period, Clemson had right under 40% of the students apply test optional and right at 30% of their admits for early action were test optional applicants.

## What are some of the things a student can do to enhance their overall application if they do not meet the average profile of the current freshman class?
Students should ensure they put their activities on their application, as this gives a better picture of how they're spending their time outside of the classroom. If a student's grades make a noticeable drop, they need to address that in their personal statement.

## What is the summer start program at Clemson University?
The summer start program allows the university to admit a population of students just below the fall admits. Students can indicate their openness to starting in the summer on the Clemson specific questions on the application, which can help them qualify for summer start if they are just below a fall admit.

## Who should students send letters of continued interest to?
Students should send letters of continued interest to their recruiters and admissions counselors for their state, rather than to the director or president of the university.

## What percentage of students at Clemson University are from out of state?
Clemson University tries to keep out-of-state enrollment at about 35% of total enrollment.

## How does Clemson University evaluate a student's academic record?
The university uses the self-reported grades indicated on the student's transcript and the self-reported weighted GPA on the application. Reviewers cross-reference this information to ensure accuracy and also evaluate the rigor of the student's coursework, specifically looking at courses relevant to the student's intended major.

## What are the different ways a student may apply to Clemson?
Students may apply to Clemson through early action or regular decision.

## Is there a benefit to applying one way over the other?
Early action may provide a quicker response time, but there is no difference in the admission decision process.

## Does Clemson offer interviews?
Clemson does not offer official evaluative interviews, but students can meet with representatives during school visits.

## What is Clemson looking for in a teacher's letter of recommendation?
