## What makes Miami University appealing for students to apply and attend?
Miami University offers the resources of a large public school but also the feel of a smaller liberal arts school. It has a student body of about 20,000 students, over 120 different majors, 500 different student clubs and activities, 19 different divisional athletic programs, and over 90 different study abroad programs. The town of Oxford, Ohio, was also ranked a top 10 college town in the entire country.

## What can you tell us about life on campus at Miami University in Ohio?
About 95% of Miami University students live within a one-mile radius of campus, and all freshmen are required to live on campus. Miami has 500 different student activities, and there is really something for everyone. Miami University also offers research opportunities as soon as students step foot on campus. Students have the opportunity to explore and find out what they are passionate about.

## How many applications does Miami University review a year and how does Tyler evaluate them?
Miami University reviews over 30,000 applications a year and Tyler personally reviewed around 800 applications in his territory in the past calendar year. The process of evaluating applications involves looking at high school transcripts, including weighted GPAs, student activities, college essays, and one teacher or counselor recommendation. Test scores are optional for the 2023 application cycle. 

## What are the different ways a student may apply to Miami and are there any benefits of applying one way over the other?
Miami University has three application deadlines: early decision (November 1st), early action 1 (November 1st), and early action 2 (December 1st), and regular decision (February 1st). There are benefits to applying early decision or early action, such as being automatically considered for merit scholarships, but early decision is a binding agreement and should only be made if a student is completely committed to attending Miami. Regular decision applicants will also be considered for merit scholarships if they meet the qualifications.

## What is the average GPA and test score profile of Miami University's freshman class?
The middle 50% range of GPA for admitted students is between a 3.59 and a 4.18, and the standardized test score range is typically between a 25 and a 31. For students who submit SAT scores, the score range is typically between 1220 and 1410.

## What can a student do to enhance their application if they fall a little below the mid-50% profile?
Miami University reviews applications holistically, taking into account each piece of information. Students can enhance their application by participating in extracurricular activities or demonstrating accomplishments in their chosen field. The college essay is also an important opportunity to showcase their personality and goals for the future.

## What does holistic application review look for in an applicant's extracurricular activities? 
They are looking for quality over quantity, with a focus on leadership roles and impact in the community. They want to see experiences that applicants can speak to and their passions, not just a long list of activities. 

## How does leaving out test scores influence financial aid awards for test-optional schools? 
It depends on the academic profile of the student. The advice is to submit scores if they are a good representation of who the student is as a student. Applying early action is advantageous and provides access to the first merit scholarship consideration. 

## What percentage of admitted students submit standardized test scores despite Miami being test-optional? 
Around 65% of admitted students submit standardized test scores. 

## Does Miami use the student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcripts or do they recalculate using their own metrics? 
If the high school weights the GPA, Miami will use that. If not, Miami will calculate the GPA on their own. They are on a 4.0 scale but will go above that if a student takes advanced courses. 

## What are Miami's admissions counselors looking for beyond the classroom in an applicant's activity sheet? 
They are looking for leadership and experience that applicants can really talk about. Growth is important, so being a member of a club and then becoming the president in junior year is excellent. They would rather see applicants involved in four or five activities that have taken up a lot of their time instead of being a participant in 20 different clubs.

## What does Miami University look for in student involvement outside of academics?
They look for passion and the ability to speak about it, regardless of whether it's tied to school or not. They also value leadership experience in any club or organization.
 
## How important are students' grades in their senior year of high school?
While the university primarily looks at freshman through junior year grades when reviewing applications, their senior year grades are important as well. It's an opportunity for students to practice the life of a college student and prepare for the academic rigor. 
 
## Does Miami University accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes for credit?
Yes, they do. Students can find specific requirements for AP and IB classes on their website, and they also accept dual enrollment and college credit plus.
 
## What are some qualities that Miami University seeks in a college essay?
They want to learn about a student's growth and passions and how they have overcome challenges. They advise students to make their essays personal and to show who they are as a person and potential member of the Miami community.

## How can students discuss their personal growth in college admission essays?  
Students can discuss their personal growth by talking about how an experience affected them. They need to reflect on what they learned from it, their thought process, and how it reveals their character and thought processes. 

## Does Miami University offer any support for students with IEPs or 504s?  
Yes, Miami University has the Miller Testing Center and Ronella Testing Center, which are resources for students with disabilities or IEPs. Admitted students can provide more information about their IEPs through the university website, and support is available for mental health and wellness as well. If students need additional support, they can contact their admissions counselor.
