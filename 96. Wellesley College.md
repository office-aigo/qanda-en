## What type of students are admitted to Wellesley College?

## Is there anything unique about the admitted student profile at Wellesley College? 
The admitted student profile at Wellesley College is diverse and encompasses various academic and personal backgrounds. The college strives for a strong fit beyond just the academic perspective and looks for students who will be active participants in the community and show leadership potential.

## What is the context crucial for admission officers to understand?
The context of an applicant's background, high school curriculum, grading system and location are crucial for admission officers to understand.

## What is the typical admitted student profile for Wellesley?
Admitted students to Wellesley typically have an A or A- average, take challenging courses offered to them, and demonstrate readiness for rigorous and deep curriculum.

## What is "demonstrated interest" at Wellesley?
Demonstrated interest at Wellesley means how familiar and informed a student is about the college community, which may be shown through a campus visit, engagement with admissions, or a supplemental essay on Why Wellesley.

## What are the different ways a student may apply to Wellesley?
A student may apply through early decision 1 or 2, or regular decision. The regular decision population is still quite strong and Wellesley wants to ensure that all students, regardless of socioeconomic background, can have that opportunity to attend.

## How does Wellesley view test optional applications?
Wellseley views test optional applications as an opportunity to evaluate each applicant's full record within the context of their available resources. While standardized tests have long served as an external benchmark of college readiness, they are one factor among many that can be considered in the admission process.

## Does Wellesley accept AP, IB or dual enrollment classes for credit?
Yes, they do. Students who receive a 4 or 5 on certain AP exams can receive credit on campus. Students who receive a 6 or 7 on certain IB exams can also receive credit. However, it varies by department and discipline. The course registrar office has a full listing of what will transfer to Wellesley based on subject area.

## How important are student's courses in progress and grades in their senior year, and what does the admissions team look for when reviewing them?
The senior year should be an indication of the level of work students are ready to commit to at Wellesley. The final senior year is likely the most relatable work that they will do when they arrive on campus. Admissions officers expect students to continue challenging themselves and being successful in the classroom. They review all final transcripts for all admitted students, ensuring that nothing has come in their way of that success that final year.

## What advice would you share with prospective students in terms of what to think about when writing their essays, and can you share some examples of college essays that really stuck with you?
The most important question to ask oneself when writing an essay is what it tells the reader about who they are as an individual. Students should utilize every single piece of the application to their advantage and to tell the admissions officers something new about themselves. There doesn't have to be some giant, huge life experience that students need to reflect on. It is essential to be authentic and utilize writing style that showcases who they are. Some of the most mundane topics, such as a student's commute to and from school, are most engaging by reflecting their personalities.

## What opportunities and resources does Wellesley College offer to ensure students continue to be successful once on campus?
The school offers various resources such as its brand new office of student success, the Wellesley Plus, and resource networks like the first-gen low-income network on campus. They also offer services based on learning diversity and accessibility and disability resources. The director of the office of accessibility and disability resources works with students to ensure they are successful in and out of the classroom, even in the prospective student process.

## What are your top three pieces of advice you would give students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Firstly, set aside one time each week where students and their families are willing to talk about the college admissions process. Secondly, be authentic to who they are and utilize every piece of the application to indicate who they are and why they are a strong fit. Lastly, utilize each different aspect of the application in the best way possible to showcase who the students are and what they are going to contribute.
