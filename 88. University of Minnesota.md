## What makes life on campus at the University of Minnesota unique?
Life on campus at the University of Minnesota is unique because the campus is split up into three sections, each with its own environment and vibe, including an urban campus, a quieter campus, and a campus with a more suburban/rural feel.

## What are some of the things that students do to demonstrate their interests in the University of Minnesota, and do they track such things? 
Students can demonstrate their interests by attending a campus visit, attending a college fair or a high school visit, or giving the university a phone call. They keep track of interest points to make sure that students are getting information consistently as they work through their college search process. However, they don't utilize that information for deciding if a student will be admitted.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class? 
For their holistic review process, they have their middle 50th percentiles, which has their core academic GPA, typically at a university level, ranging from about a 3.5 to a 3.95. They are test optional, but if a student chooses to submit a test score, they usually see ACTs ranging from about a 28 to a 33, and with those new SAT scores from about a 1330 to a 1480. 

## How are students considered for the honors program? 
When a student applies for admission to the university, they are automatically considered for admission to the honors program. Typically, the top 10% of admitted students will be offered admission to the honors program based on the academic factors that they previously mentioned, but there is still an opportunity to get involved in the honors program even if the student isn't invited right off the bat in year one. 

## Do they use the student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcript, or do they recalculate using their own metrics? 
They review all types of GPAs that are provided to them, including the high school's weighted or unweighted GPA, in addition to their core calculated GPA, which shows what that GPA translates to in terms of Minnesota's work scale. 

## What are the different ways a student may apply to the University of Minnesota, and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other? 
Students can apply using the Common Application or their in-house application, the Golden Gopher Application. They don't have a preference on what students use, and they have three different deadlines for applying. 

## Can you share the percentage of students that apply and that are ultimately admitted that did not in fact submit their test scores?

Students are encouraged to keep up the rigor of their coursework and demonstrate continued academic success.
## What advice would you give a student as they prepare to write their college essay?
Students should write about something that will make their personality and character shine through. The most impactful essays share something that cannot be seen from just looking at the application. Students should share interests and hobbies as well as stories about obstacles they have overcome.
