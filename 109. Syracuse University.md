Students have the option to transition into eight other different schools if they change their mind in the first or second year. Syracuse University is a large research one university, but average class size is about 26 students. Study abroad partnerships and globally engaging a student's resume is something that Syracuse University values. The university has over 300 clubs and organizations on campus. Syracuse University is located in the heart of Central New York and is a great location for students who may not want to be right in the center of a big city, but still have big cities within five to six hours of driving distance for internships and co-ops and semesters away. Notable alumni is another thing that Eva Bori mentions. Alumni are always coming back onto campus to build connections and networks with current students. Alumni are from different categories such as Hollywood actors, Olympic gold medalists, Pulitzer Prize winners, and many more.

They should register for available open houses, daily visits, virtual events that Syracuse offers. Students can also connect with teams from the nine different schools within Syracuse that all have their own recruiting offices and make sure that students are putting their names on these schools' radars. Students should talk to current students, asking about their own majors, research opportunities, internships, residential and study abroad experiences, and career-related statistics such as percentage of students graduating and successfully employed post-graduation or in graduate programs. They can also ask about admission requirements and deadlines, four plus one programs, and who their specific admission counselors are.

While legacy is something that students should disclose on their application, it does not replace meeting the academic requirements and eligibility for the specific programs. The admissions process is based on academic credentials and eligibility. However, disclosing legacy is important for the admissions team to know about the Syracuse connection and special populations such as first-generation students.

## What advice does Eva give to students who are worried about not being admitted to their desired colleges?
Eva advises students to trust the admission process and not to focus on being waitlisted or denied from a school. She recommends creating a list of schools that the student has really connected with and that the student is a good fit for. She emphasizes the importance of preparation and staying connected with the schools throughout the process.

## What kind of advice does Eva give about college essays?
Eva advises students to reflect on who they are and what they are looking to get out of college. She recommends using personal experiences, character traits, strengths, weaknesses, passions, and how challenges have been dealt with to create a valuable essay. She suggests that students should gather feedback and be as creative and authentic as possible.

## What is Eva looking for on the activity sheet beyond academic achievements?
Eva believes that what students do outside the classroom is as important as their academic credentials. She wants to see activities that the student has invested the majority of their time in, even if that means fewer activities. She points out that clubs, sports, jobs, and any other involvement outside the classroom give admission counselors insight into the studentâ€™s character.

## How important is it for a student to withdraw from other colleges once they commit to one?
It is important for a student to withdraw from other colleges to make room for other eligible students to attend those colleges. Eva notes that being waitlisted or denied does not mean a student is not academically eligible, but rather, it is about institutional priorities and numbers. She encourages students to apply to multiple institutions and find multiple good fits for them.

## What should applicants do if they are not able to get admitted in the first year?
They should have a conversation about what transferring looks like and the advantages of transferring in the second year. They can also be kept on track for a four or five year graduation timeline if they are doing a four plus one program. Most schools will be open to having those conversations, and there are transfer teams that work with transfer students and graduate students. The admissions office wants to set students up for success in the process and will work closely with them to determine next steps if admission is not offered in the first year.

## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
The first piece of advice is to know that the admissions team wants to hear from prospective students and families. It is a partnership, and they are here to support and advocate for students in the admissions committees. The more interest a student demonstrates, the easier it makes it for the team to advocate for them. The second piece of advice is to visit and engage with schools, starting as early as freshman or sophomore year. Fill out inquiry forms to be placed on the schools' radars, and take advantage of physical visits and virtual opportunities. The earlier the process starts, the better. The third piece of advice is to start early and stay ahead of deadlines and requirements. Sophomore and junior years are advantageous for building academic profiles and establishing an upward trend on transcripts. Stay ahead of deadlines and work to build a network of references as early as sophomore and junior year. Identifying teachers and counselors that can write strong recommendation letters and speak on behalf of academic trends can leave a lasting impression. It is important to know that admissions committees look at profiles holistically.
