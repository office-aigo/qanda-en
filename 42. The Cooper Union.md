## What makes Cooper Union appealing for students to want to apply and attend?
Cooper Union's focus on societal impact and collaborative environment, as well as its location in the heart of the East Village, contribute to its appeal.
## How can students apply to Cooper Union?
Students can apply through the Common Application. Engineering students need to complete a supplement with three questions. Architecture and art students need to complete home/studio tests that evoke emotional responses and submit visual renderings.
## What scholarship opportunities does Cooper Union provide?
Cooper Union offers a half-price tuition scholarship valued at $22,275 per year for every undergraduate year of attendance for engineering and art students and all five years for architecture students.

## Does Cooper Union provide additional merit aid to students?
Yes, Cooper Union evaluates every student for additional merit aid, which is smaller amounts than the half-price tuition scholarship, and it is immediately done through the application process without any additional applications required.

## How important is the FAFSA in Cooper Union's admission process?
The FAFSA is a very important part of Cooper Union's admission process as a number of students pay significantly less than their advertised rate given the amount of need-based aid that the school is able to provide.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Cooper Union?
Cooper Union is highly competitive and for engineering students, the school looks for students who have taken the highest levels of math and science classes that are available, particularly within calculus and physics. Art students are able to showcase their artistic potential and talent through a home test and a portfolio submission. Architecture students have a cross between mathematics and design, with experience in art classes and thinking about design.

## Does Cooper Union recalculate GPA using their own metrics?
No, Cooper Union uses the GPA as indicated on the transcript and does not recalculate it. The school profiles included to know how the school wants to utilize the data that's been provided.

## What advice would you give to a student if they fall lower than the mid-50% of the current freshman class in Cooper Union?
Students should always apply and explain any obstacles they faced in the additional information section of the common application. They should also address any issues they faced and emphasize any extracurricular activities that make them an outstanding applicant.

## How should students demonstrate their interest in attending Cooper Union?
Students should attend the open house in the fall for engineering, art, and architecture, where they can talk to faculty members and current students. Cooper Union does not formally keep track of whether students attend in person or virtually.

## What are some examples of college essays that really stood out to Cooper Union?
Essays that provide glimpses into a student's regular life and experiences with family members or classmates are the ones that stand out to Cooper Union.

## What are the two important pieces of information that admissions officers look for in an application?
The first is a personal essay that gives insight into the student's personality and character. The second is the supplementary questions, which are particularly important for engineering applicants, as they provide information about the student's goals and interests in the field.

## Why does the admissions team care about the supplementary questions, especially for engineering applicants?
The admissions team wants to know what the student hopes to accomplish with their degree and what specifically draws them to the field of engineering, even if the student has no prior experience. This helps the admissions team understand the varied interests and backgrounds that each applicant will bring to the program.

## What advice does Hilary give to parents and students who are preparing to apply to college?
Hilary advises students to enjoy the application process, despite its stressors. She emphasizes the human element of the admissions process and encourages students to remember that the admissions team is made up of people who care about each applicant as an individual. Additionally, Hilary reminds students that the college they attend may not necessarily be their dream school but can still lead to a fulfilling and successful college experience.
