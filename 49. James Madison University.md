## What new trends in the college admissions process are there?
The biggest trend in college admissions at the moment is the test-optional path due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many schools have gone test-optional for the past two years, and this has changed how admissions counselors evaluate student applications.

## Did COVID change the way JMU reviewed their applications?
No, JMU has been test optional for several years, and COVID did not change the way they reviewed applications. They still focused on final grades, rigor, progression, and other aspects. However, they did take into consideration the difficulty of the past two years due to the pandemic when reviewing grades and patterns.

## What kind of college essays really stick with JMU?
JMU technically does not require essays, but when a student submits one, the essay should showcase the student's personality and real-life experiences. Students should provide details to help the admissions committee build a picture of their whole self. JMU prefers essays that are unique, creative, and fun and that make them want to meet the student in person. 

## What is JMU looking for in teacher letters of recommendation?
Letters of recommendation are optional at JMU. If a student decides to submit one, JMU prefers a letter from a teacher who knows the student really well or one who the student struggled with but eventually became successful in their class. These teachers can provide meaningful insight into the student's character and their ability to overcome obstacles.

## How important are students' grades and courses in progress in their senior year?
At JMU, students' grades and courses in progress in their senior year are very important. JMU wants to see that students have continued their progress and have taken core classes in their areas of interest. They also want students to communicate with them if they are struggling so that they can help.

## Does JMU offer an honors college, and how are students identified for the program?
JMU does offer an honors college, and the application is open to anyone. Students are identified based on their essay component of the application. The honors college has its own deadlines, so students need to pay attention to those. Once on campus, the benefits of being in the honor college include enriched curriculum, faculty mentorship, research and scholarly opportunities, study abroad, priority enrollment, and honors housing.

## What advice does Joanna have for prospective student athletes in terms of making their intentions to play known?
Joanna advises prospective student athletes to check their college's athletic website where they can find the coach's information and a recruit me form, fill out the form, or email the coach. The more one can make themselves known, the better off they will be. One of the most important things is deciding what kind of level of athletics one wants to be a part of. D1 is very strict and restricted, while D2 is a little less strict, and D3 offers a balance between athletics and academics.

## What are the top three pieces of advice Joanna would offer prospective students and their parents who are starting the college admissions process now?
(1) Get on campuses. If you can, try to get there in fall and spring of your senior year, as it is a different feel getting on campus as a prospective student and as an admitted student, and it's hugely important for the admissions process. (2) Figure out what one wants out of their experience in college and make sure that the school one is looking at has those experiences to offer. (3) Talk to your admissions counselor early enough to clarify any questions or concerns, as it is their job to help students through the process.
