She worked in financial aid for a little while before going back to admissions and working in grad admissions and international admissions. 

## What is the SUPA program at Syracuse University?
The SUPA program at Syracuse University is a program for high school students that offers college-level classes for which students can earn college credit through Syracuse University. The classes are taught by Syracuse professors who come to the school four times a year to meet with teachers. The teachers have to be trained by Syracuse professors to participate in the program.

## What does Syracuse University offer that makes it appealing for students to apply?
Syracuse University offers small classroom sizes despite being a mid-sized university. The university is made up of individual colleges that have an enrollment of a few thousand to a few hundred students each. This enables faculty to really get to know their students and for students to get to know each other in a personal way. The university is a large research institution with the highest level of research that takes place on a college campus. There are ample resources and opportunities for students to engage with their environment and build relationships with the city of Syracuse. The university's Division I sports program contributes to a strong sense of school spirit. 

## How many applications does Syracuse University review each year?
Syracuse University reviewed close to 41,000 applications this year. 

## Does Asma Malik represent the Tri-State area or Long Island?
Asma Malik is based in the Manhattan Academic Center but represents Syracuse University as a whole.

## Can you explain the admissions process at Syracuse University?
Syracuse University receives a high volume of applications from the metro New York area and has a competitive admissions process. Each admissions officer has specific territories to cover and interacts with prospective students from those areas. The office has a team of four in charge of recruiting in this area due to the high application volume. They read every application multiple times, and every college within the university has its own admissions team. The office values individual team reviews as they believe it is not fair to have one person make the final decision. Syracuse University is test-optional, and the average SAT score is close to 1280, and the ACT score is about 28. The average GPA is about 3.65 unweighted, but the context of the high school is very important, and trend analysis is necessary to decide whether to admit students. 
## How do you calculate GPA at Syracuse University?
Syracuse University takes into account the high school's GPA, but they also calculate their own GPA based on the core subjects, such as math, science, social studies, English, and foreign languages. Every high school calculates GPAs differently, and the school profile is necessary to understand what the GPA really means.
## How do admissions officers decide which students to admit?
Admissions officers look at the transcript, high school profile, progression from year to year, and the type of classes students take. They calculate the applicant's GPA and take into account the context of the high school and what is being offered to students. Admissions officers want to admit students who will be successful in the classroom and not set them up to fail. 
## How important are guidance counselors in the college application process?
Guidance counselors are a tremendous resource in the college application process. They often have relationships with admissions officers and can advocate for their students. Admissions officers also rely on guidance counselors to give them context about individual schools and students. 
## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Syracuse University?
Syracuse University is test-optional, and the average SAT score is close to 1280, and the ACT score is about 28. The average GPA is about 3.65 unweighted. However, the context of the high school is essential, and trend analysis is necessary to decide whether to admit students. Syracuse University has a high retention rate of more than 90%, indicating that the admissions office does an excellent job selecting students who belong to the university.

## What does a well-rounded class mean for colleges? 
A well-rounded class means building a class with diverse talents and interests, not necessarily expecting every student to be well-rounded. 

## How important is it for students to challenge themselves appropriately? 
It is important for students to challenge themselves appropriately and not take every single AP or dual enrollment class if it will negatively impact their grades. Knowing one's limits and working with guidance counselors can be helpful in this process. 

## How do colleges assess a student's progression throughout high school? 
Colleges place emphasis on 11th grade grades as they are the most recent and demonstrate how a student may perform in college. Senior year grades and course selections are also important as they can show progression in rigor and potential success in college coursework. 

## How do disruptions due to the pandemic impact the college application process? 
Disruptions due to the pandemic can be addressed in the common application's disruption section. It is important for students to use their time outside of the classroom in a productive way that demonstrates growth and potential for success in college. 

## What else can students do to make their application more appealing to colleges? 
Students can write well-written essays, build good relationships with teachers for strong letters of recommendation, and engage in extracurricular activities that demonstrate growth. Optional interviews can also provide an opportunity for students to add a voice and explain their experiences and potential.

## What advice would you give a student in terms of writing their essay for Syracuse University?
Take a step back and make a list of things that are related to who you are as a person, your personality, and your characteristics. Be creative and tell something that can't be found in any other part of the application. Common application prompts are amazing, but there are sometimes too many options. It's important to convey a 17- or 18-year-old voice.
 
## Can you give an example of an essay that impressed you?
One student talked about learning how to make a soup. It was her grandmother's recipe, and she pieced it together from everyone's different perspective in her family. Every ingredient she put in, she tied it into her personality. It was so simple but creative. She conveyed her personality and how it related to the classroom. 
 
## How does Syracuse University support students with IEPs or 504s?
Syracuse University assigns every student an academic advisor, and there is career advising available as well. Academic support is available for all students through the Center for Learning and Student Success. Living and learning communities are available so that students can live with others who have similar interests and build study centers. Syracuse University also has the Cultural Center for Disability Services.

## When can students start reaching out to universities for resources? 
Students can start on the process early on in the admissions process. They don't have to be admitted to reach out to universities to find out what resources would be available to them. 

## How can students find out what resources are available to them at SU? 
Students can provide documentation explaining the resources they receive in high school, and advisors at SU would come up with a list of resources that would be available to them. Students can search for Disability Center on the SU website and get in touch through email or phone for more information. 

## Does SU offer more resources than what high schools offer? 
Yes, 90% of the time, SU offers more resources than what students are receiving in high school. Most of the time, additional costs are not required. 

## Is there any extra cost associated with the programs that provide extra support beyond the standard resources? 
Yes, there is an additional fee for these programs, but many students and families are thrilled because it is customized based on every semester. 

## When should students reach out to universities for more information about resources? 
It's better for students to be proactive and find out what resources are available to them in advance, rather than to struggle and have to put everything together once they have started at university. 

## Does a college's Disability Center offer support for students with IEPs? 
Yes, Asma Malik from SU recommends checking for Disability Center on the SU website, which is the first hit on a search, and reaching out to their counselors who are amazing. 

## Is it possible to have a conversation with the Disability Center on Zoom? 
Yes, the Disability Center usually sets up a time to chat over Zoom with students and their parents, as it is a joint effort. 

## What are some helpful tips for writing a college essay? 
Students should ask themselves, "What did the admissions officer learn about me after reading my essay?" If they cannot answer this question, then they need to keep working on the essay. The essay is an opportunity to give the admissions representative some insight into their personality and who they are as a person. 

## How does the progress of grades from senior year affect college admissions? 
Colleges expect to see an upward progression in the grades students are receiving. Mid-year grade reports are sent to colleges, and they do not want to see a downward trend that late in the game.
