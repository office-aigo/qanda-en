## What factors helped Cameron get recruited to play soccer at Lafayette College?
Cameron believes it was a combination of things including her play in high school, her academy team, videos submitted to college coaches, showcases, and prospect days. However, she believes the most important factor was her coach from her academy team who helped her make a list of potential schools and provided a personal recommendation to coaches at different colleges.

## What was the transition like for Cameron from high school to college soccer?
The transition was drastic for Cameron. The competition was much fiercer in college with everyone vying to be a starter. In high school, there was a more relaxed atmosphere with less pressure to perform. Cameron also had to adjust to playing a new position and splitting time with an upperclassman in her first year.

## What is a typical day in the life of a college student athlete at the Division I level?
A typical day involves practice for three to four hours, lifts three times a week, and film sessions after every game individually and as a team. There are also individual or group sessions. Time management is crucial, especially with midweek games and long bus trips.

## What advice would you give students aspiring to play in college?
Be open to opportunities and don't get fixated on only a few top schools. Embrace your high school coach and include them in the process. Take a breath and remain positive through the mentally challenging recruitment process.

## How did COVID affect your player eligibility and how does player eligibility work with the NCAA?
Cameron was eligible for another year due to COVID but had already figured out her post-grad plan. NCAA player eligibility is different for each league, but athletes are guaranteed four years. The Patriot and Ivy leagues do not allow for redshirting or a fifth year unless a full year is taken off.

## What is your experience with recruitment and what would you change if you had to go through it again?
