## What is the purpose of the CAP college admissions process podcast?
The purpose of the podcast is to interview college admission representatives and other professionals in the field of college admissions to serve students and parents by providing insight and advice on every aspect of the college admissions process.
## Who is the host of the CAP podcast?
The host of the podcast is Dr. John Durante.
## Who is the guest for this episode?
The guest for this episode is Samantha Rose Sinclair, who is the Assistant Director of Admissions at Georgia Tech.
## How long has Samantha been working in admissions, and how did she end up in such a position?
Samantha has been working in admissions for around seven years. She graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2015 and was interviewed the day after for her first admission role. She has worked for three public institutions, with Georgia Tech being her home for the longest time.
## What makes Georgia Tech appealing to students?
Georgia Tech's commitment to innovative learning and providing opportunities for students to immediately apply that learning to create change in the world around them make the institution appealing to students. They offer 36 majors in liberal arts, design, science, business, computing, and engineering, with many of their programs being the largest of their kind in the country. Georgia Tech has been creating partnerships with companies for over 100 years that students can leverage for internships or co-ops. Students can also explore work experience, study abroad, creative projects, and entrepreneurship opportunities. Georgia Tech has the largest voluntary co-op program in the country.
## What is campus life like outside of the classroom at Georgia Tech?
Georgia Tech has 400 acres of its own contiguous space in Midtown Atlanta, which lends itself to a really engaged campus community. There are over 500 student organizations, intramural, club, and Division 1 sports. There are also opportunities for students to explore different things outside of their comfort zone.

## Can you explain the Georgia Tech Filipino Student Organization's recent viral video?
The Georgia Tech Filipino Student Organization's modernized version of a traditional Filipino dance to a Lil Nas X song went viral on TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter, receiving millions of views and global international news coverage, including a retweet from Lil Nas X. They achieved world records and garnered world news coverage just last week alone. 
## Is outdoor activities available at Georgia Tech?
Georgia Tech's outdoor program hosts over a hundred day trips for students interested in activities like kayaking, hiking, backpacking, and also provides leadership and outdoor programs on campus and longer treks domestically and internationally. 
## How many applications does Georgia Tech review a year and is there a specific region assigned to each reviewer?
Georgia Tech's admission reviewers do not have specific regional assignments. Instead, they have larger sections of the country or the world that are reviewed by a team or group of admission reviewers. Samantha, who works with students in the Northeast, usually works with students in New York and New Jersey. Last year, the school received almost 5,000 applications from just those two states. 
## Are there any differences in the application process based on major?
The application requirements and review process are generally the same for all majors, except for the College of Design, which accepts portfolios reviewed by their faculty, and some majors like Music Technology, which requires a portfolio and separate application. 
## What is the current profile of the freshman class at Georgia Tech?
Samantha explains that not all GPAs are created equal, and while Georgia Tech does not recalculate students' GPAs, generally, students are receiving primarily A's or equivalent in more rigorous courses available to them at their high school. 29% of the incoming students last year were valedictorian or salutatorian, and 90% were in the top 10%. Standardized test scores are not included on admission material and profiles anymore, but the enrolling SAT score was around 1370 to 1520, and the average enrolling ACT was between 31 to 35. Georgia Tech places a higher value on course choice, performance, involvement, and impact outside the classroom rather than test scores.

## If a prospective student falls a little below the current freshman average, what are some of the things they can do to enhance their application?
According to a Georgia Tech admission counselor, a student who is lower within their academic profile but has incredible impact outside the classroom or has shared something in their essays that highlights they are a great fit for the university can showcase non-quantifiable pieces of the application that can enhance their profile.

## Do universities use the student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcript, or do they recalculate using their own metrics?
Generally, universities use the GPA on the transcript, but they might recalculate it in cases where a student switches high schools, if those courses aren't brought into the new transcript and there's not really one singular GPA, or in cases where a GPA is never really calculated at all.

## What are some of the things admission counselors look for in a student's activity sheet?
At Georgia Tech, admission counselors look at a student's "contribution to community" beyond extracurricular activities. This can include their impact in the larger sense, what communities they are a part of, what they're excited about, what they're spending time doing, such as school organizations, community activities, private organizations, service organizations, or hobbies they've picked up at home.

## What are some examples of college essays that really stick with admission counselors?
Essays that leave an impression on admission counselors are those that tell a story about the student and what can be learned about them that isn't evident in the rest of their application. One example given was a student who wrote about how she solved the problem of heating up her food in a hotel room without a microwave, demonstrating her creative problem-solving skills that aligned with Georgia Tech's motto of progress and service.

## How important are letters of recommendations in the admission process, and what are admission counselors looking for in those letters?
Letters of recommendation are accepted up to two from a high school counselor and/or a teacher who has taught a student in an academic sense. Admission counselors look for comments that highlight a student's academic strengths and personal qualities, a comparison to other students the teacher has taught, and specific examples that illustrate the student's character and potential.

## What information can be learned from letters of recommendation in the college admissions process? 
Letters of recommendation can provide insights into who the student is in the eyes of another adult, such as their problem-solving skills, collaboration abilities, approach to challenges, and learning style. This can come from any teacher who knows the student well, not just a math or science teacher. However, due to the variations in access to counselors in high schools, it is not always possible for students to obtain a letter of recommendation from a high school counselor. The most important aspect in a student's application is what they can tell admission counselors about themselves. A letter of recommendation is helpful but not required.

## How are senior year grades and courses in progress considered in the admissions process? 
Senior year grades and midterms have not been necessarily required in previous admission cycles. These grades may come into play when students are deferred from early action review to regular decision review, or when they apply straight away to regular decision. Senior year grades can play a small role in the admissions process but are typically not considered alone. Submission of updated transcripts can also show grades trends and achievements over time. Reviewers consider individual coursework, rigor, student academic performance trends, and interests over the past three years to understand a larger story of the student's academic history.

## What advice should students and parents consider in the college admissions process? 
Samantha provides three pieces of advice. Firstly, students should aim to control what they can control about their application, such as making good choices for themselves and displaying their best foot forward. Second, parents should consider their role as supportive consultants rather than managers since the college admissions process should emphasize the student's independence and growth. Finally, students could listen to The College Admission Brief, a podcast from Georgia Tech which provides insights into the admission process in general and discusses applications, theory, and practices.
