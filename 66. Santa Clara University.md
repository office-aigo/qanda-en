The quarter system reflects real-world expectations, where you aren't given months to work on a project.
 
## How many applications does Santa Clara University review per year?
Santa Clara receives just over 17,000 first year applications and about 1,100 transfer applications. As the Dean of Admission, my role is really to oversee the reading process, and I take on some geographic areas, however, our team represents various regions across the US and the world. We have a reading team that includes admission counselors and external and part-time readers. We really read by high school and region because that gives us context for the applicant. 
 
## What is the overall application process at Santa Clara University?
We have a holistic review process that considers both academics and personal traits. We look at potential achievement based on grade history, challenging courses, and teacher's recommendations. For the personal aspect, we look at extracurricular activities, leadership opportunities, and community engagement. We require a main common app essay and a couple of Santa Clara supplement questions. We're looking for students who understand our value-driven community and engage in social and environmental issues or care about their neighbors and want to join an intentional community. We're trying to find these students who can imagine themselves on our campus and meet our mission of recruiting and enrolling a diverse, academically strong, socially conscious student population.

Santa Clara University does not share its average test scores because the data is skewed. Those who submit scores in a test-optional environment tend to submit their strongest scores, which can be inflated, and the university does not want to discourage other talented students from applying.

## What is the evaluation process for a student's transcript at Santa Clara University?
The evaluation process for a student's transcript at Santa Clara University involves looking for context in the transcript. The school profile, the school's offering, and grades achieved for ninth through twelfth grades are considered. Advanced courses taken, grade trends, and progression in relation to the student's area of interest are also evaluated. Unweighted GPAs are recalculated to help the admission committee understand the student's story.

## What is the most available way for students to demonstrate their interest in Santa Clara University?
The most available way for students to demonstrate their interest in Santa Clara University is through the supplemental questions on the Common App. The supplemental questions offer students the opportunity to reflect on the university's mission and values and how they have or will use those values in their future. Applying and completing the application process is also beneficial for showing interest in the university.

## What are the different ways a student may apply to Santa Clara University? 
There are two main deadlines for applying to Santa Clara University. The November 1st deadline includes early decision one and early action. Early action is non-binding and early decision is binding. The January 7th deadline includes early decision two, which is also binding, and regular decision, which is non-binding.

## How does the application process for transfer students differ?
Transfer students use the Common App, and the fall transfer application is rolling admission, meaning that it opens in January and decisions are released monthly until April 15th, which is the last date for a transfer student to apply. Decisions roll out just after that and through the first week of May. 

## Is there a benefit to applying earlier for rolling admission for transfer students? 
Yes, the sooner that a transfer student applies for fall, the better. Waiting until April 15th might result in certain majors being full, such as computer science engineering in Silicon Valley. 

## How many students did not submit their test scores in the last two years at Santa Clara University? 
In the last two years at Santa Clara University, about 47% of students reported test scores in the overall applicant pool, and who they admitted ended up being just over 51-52% of students each year.

## What advice does Becky have for prospective student-athletes regarding letting their intentions to play sports in college known?
Becky advises prospective student-athletes to start early, organize their video clips and sport profiles, and start contacting coaches. She reminds students that recruitment at the Division I level is serious and not run by the admission office, so they must cast their net wide and try to connect with as many coaches as possible.

## What are Becky's top three pieces of advice for students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
