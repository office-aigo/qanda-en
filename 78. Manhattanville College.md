## What areas should a prospective student visit when they tour Manhattanville College?
Prospective students should visit areas such as residence halls, specialty chapels, and facilities such as science labs, but the most important thing is to talk to current students and ask questions about the college experience. Manhattanville College encourages the exploration of campus without the guidance of admissions counselors to better understand what it would be like to be a student there.

## How important is it to immerse oneself in the culture of a college when considering applying? It's very important as it helps students get a feel for whether or not the school is the right fit for them. It's recommended that students talk to random students on campus and go to a dining hall to have a meal. ## How important are a student's grades in their senior year when applying to colleges? It depends on the applicant. For early action students, they receive admission decisions based on their first three years of high school grades before their senior year grades are in. For regular decision applicants, senior year grades may be reviewed, but it's important to have a strong transcript for all four years. ## What advice does Troy have for prospective students when sitting down to write their college essay? Troy advises students to write about personal struggles they have overcome or recognized they are battling with. It's about how students have overcome the issue and succeeded beyond it. ## What opportunities does Manhattanville offer students with learning differences or an IEP in high school? Manhattanville offers the Pathways and Connections program (PACT) for students with learning differences or who need extra help. PACT provides individualized meetings, weekly group sessions, peer mentoring, social events, and summer camp opportunities. There are also services available for all students on campus.

## What is the benefit of attending a smaller school like Manhattanville College with a Division III sports program?

Manhattanville College provides opportunities for students to play sports without capping too many teams, such as by adding junior varsity teams in basketball for men and baseball.
