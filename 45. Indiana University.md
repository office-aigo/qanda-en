IU is an early action school, with a non-binding deadline of November 1. Students who complete their application by this date have priority consideration for admission and scholarship money. Regular decision deadline is February 1. IU is also test optional, and students should submit their test score if they fit within the middle 50% range.

Yes, you should submit your test scores if they correlate nicely with your high school transcript. However, if you question it, you can reach out to an admissions counselor to have a conversation.

## Should you declare a major on your application for Indiana University?
It doesn't matter if you declare a major on your application for Indiana University.

Exceptions include specialized career choices like music or Bachelor's of Fine Arts (BFA) programs.

## Does Indiana University recalculate high school GPAs?
Indiana University will use the student's highest cumulative GPA on their high school transcript as one factor in their review process. If the GPA is not on a 4.0 scale, they will convert it.

## What makes a college essay stand out to Indiana University admissions counselors?
Admissions counselors are looking for students to be genuine and write about themselves and their interests. It's not about being a great writer but proofreading for errors. Essays that stand out are ones where students are passionate about something or describe a situation they overcame. The essay is not a make or break point for the application.

## What does the activity sheet show to Indiana University admissions counselors?
The activity sheet shows that a student has done something outside of academics. Admissions counselors are looking for students who will fit academically and socially into their community. It's not about a specific number but the balance of extracurricular activities, jobs, responsibilities, and interests.

## How can a student show their serious intentions to attend Indiana University?
A student only needs to reach out when they have a question or need to supply additional context for something. There's no pressure to reach out to admissions counselors multiple times or have a certain number of contact points. Admissions counselors appreciate thoughtful correspondences and answering personalized questions.

## What scholarship opportunities does Indiana University offer for academic achievement?
Students must have a complete application by November 1 to be considered for academic scholarships. Indiana University offers several academic scholarships recognizing students' academic achievement. A separate application is not required as admissions counselors award them based on the application, including official transcripts, IU specific essay, and self-reported or official test scores. Eligible students may also receive a personalized selective scholarship application for many schools and departmental scholarships and programs.

## How does Brandi evaluate varying state assessments?
Brandi does not put much weight on assessments from different states since they are not the same across the board. 

## Can the regents exams from New York be used in the review process?
Regent exams can be used for context to provide some extra or supplementary information but would never negatively impact a student's decision in the review process. 

## What other advice does Brandi offer prospective students and their parents during the college admissions process?
Brandi offers three pieces of advice to take away at this point in the admissions process. The first priority is deadlines. The organization is critical, so making sure that supplemental materials are in and meeting the scholarship and funding deadlines as well. Secondly, the student should be the one filling out the application and make sure to use an email address that they check often to receive admissions correspondences. Lastly, Brandi advises taking a moment to enjoy the last year of high school and remember that every student will find the right school for them.
