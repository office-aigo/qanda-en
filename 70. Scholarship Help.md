## How did Monica start her scholarship journey? 
Monica started her scholarship journey when her son was going into his senior year of high school and he was looking at colleges that cost $60,000 a year. Since Monica and her husband lived paycheck to paycheck, they did not have a 529 and started looking into scholarships. Monica realized that there was a need for research and guidance for scholarships, and she partnered with her son to apply to scholarships, ultimately paying for his first year of college.

## What is Monica's strategy for applying for scholarships? 
Monica's strategy for applying for scholarships is to apply smart. This involves sharing personal details, marketing yourself, answering the essay question, reviewing guidelines, and getting trusted eyes. Students should apply for true scholarships that need an essay, letter of recommendation, video, or transcript.

Students should avoid no essay scholarships as those are like lotteries and do not require much effort. True scholarships require more effort but are more worthwhile in the end.
