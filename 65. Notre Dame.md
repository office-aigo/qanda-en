Don Bishop reviews applications holistically and is guided by his extensive research on how to predict student success. He looks at over 50 to 60 attributes that a student might have, rather than just their grades and test scores. He is the final judge on admissions decisions, but also works collaboratively with the admissions committee.

## What factors are considered when reviewing college applications?
Class performance, rigor of coursework, grade trends, testing scores, school profile, and motivation are all considered.
 
## How are GPAs evaluated during the review process?
Weighted GPAs provided by the high school are used and there is no recalculation. However, the context of the school and the distribution of grades are also taken into consideration. 
 
## How do high schools impact the admission process if they don't provide information about grades?
Colleges will look at the history of the school's applicants and try not to penalize those who don't provide information. However, high schools without information may be disadvantaging their students. There is a conversation about standardizing grades, but there is currently no such system.

Colleges are interested in a student's motivation and value system. They want to see how well a student has done in their chosen priorities. Additionally, the admission process takes into account the whole profile of the student. 
 
## How has the prevalence of straight A's in high school changed over time?

There is early action, which is restricted early action. And then there is regular action.

But if they apply early and get into Notre Dame, they're free to apply in the regular action process to any other school in America.

## 学生在申请圣母大学时是如何表达自己的兴趣的? 学校是否会追踪这些信息?
在过去的25年里，华盛顿邮报、华尔街日报、纽约时报等媒体报道了一些高度选择性的学校跟踪学生表达兴趣的情况，并根据这些数据对申请人进行评分，暗示公众如果在候选人之间优势巨大，则更可能被录取。在学校中，表达兴趣的方式可能包括告诉学校你为什么对该校感兴趣，列举你欣赏该校的独特之处，以及如果获准入学，你将如何发挥这种欣赏。圣母大学也会关注申请者的表达兴趣的方式，而更重要的是，申请者能否向该校阐述他们为何对该校有兴趣，并能否将其个性化，具有真实性和接近性。
## 学生表达兴趣时的最佳方法是什么? 圣母大学对展现学生兴趣的方式进行评分吗?
避免只重复学校已经通过其网站和视觉手册提供的信息，表达个人的兴趣和想法。圣母大学不会对学生通过何种方式表达兴趣进行打分，但学校会重视学生是否能清晰明了地展现圣母大学对他们的独特价值感和理解，以及在获得录取后是否能充分利用圣母大学所提供的各种资源。

## What should be included in the ideal essay for college applications?
The ideal essays should focus on three elements: the student's sense of motivation, the story they choose to tell, and what they have learned from that experience. They should also show how that experience has changed them as a person. The essay is about the student, not just their accomplishments. 

## What should teachers focus on in their letters of recommendation for college applications?
Teachers should describe the student's attitude towards learning, their resilience, determination to overcome struggles, generosity towards fellow students, and citizenship in the school and community. Teachers should provide commentary on the student's personality as a learner in order to provide a multi-dimensional picture of the student. 

## What should be included in the activity sheet for college applications?
The activity sheet should not focus on the quantity, but the depth of the student's commitment to a few important activities. The student should mention their motivation for joining, what they learned from the experience, and how it enhanced their life. The most important activity should be focused on and fleshed out. 

## How accurate is the movie "Rudy" and what does it represent?
The majority of the movie "Rudy" is accurate. Rudy's ambition, motivation, heart, and soul are represented in the film. It took him about 10 years to write the script, and he had to pester everyone to make it happen. The movie represents that it is not just about test scores and grades, but also about the ambition and motivation that one possesses.

## What is the main advice that Don provides for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?
Don's main advice for students and parents preparing for college admissions is to keep their dignity in the process. He believes that many students spend too much time in high school trying to get into college, instead of focusing on making the most of their high school experience. He advises them to be themselves and not get caught up in listening to others and what they think the numbers are or who the colleges admit. Don urges students to spend time understanding what college means for them and how it can improve them as a person. He also warns students against paying for organizations that package them as a product and encourages them to present themselves authentically. 

## What is Don's opinion of companies that offer to help students prepare for college admissions?
Don is cautious of companies that offer to help students prepare for college admissions and advise them to pay for packaging. He advises students not to pay for these companies, as they often present students with the same strategies and scripts. According to Don, these companies often use failed Ivy League graduates or former admissions officers in their staff, which can be a red flag. He encourages students to present themselves authentically and avoid artificial strategies. 

## What is Don's view on evaluating oneself before deciding on a college to attend?
Don believes that evaluating oneself is critical before selecting a college to attend. He urges students to ask themselves what college can do for them and how they can become a better version of themselves and not just focus on getting into a highly-rated college. Don encourages students to research thoroughly what a general college experience should be like and talk to employers to understand what qualities they look for in college graduates. Students should then choose the school where their personality and goals merge into a better version of themselves.
