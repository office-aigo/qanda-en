## What is the College Admissions Process Podcast? 
The College Admissions Process Podcast is a show where college representatives and professionals in the field of college admissions provide insights and advice to students and parents about the college admissions process.

## Who is the guest on the podcast and what is his background? 
Robert Petrusari, the Associate Dean of Admissions at Stony Brook University is the guest on the podcast. He has been in the college admissions field for almost 30 years, and is also an alumnus of Stony Brook.

## What makes Stony Brook University appealing to students? 
Stony Brook University is a flagship school within the SUNY system with diverse academic programs and offerings, diversity in the student population, faculty, and staff, and diverse co-curricular experiences. It is a high-quality education at an affordable cost, located close to New York City, and has a picturesque campus.

## How many applications does Stony Brook University receive each year and how are they evaluated? 
Stony Brook University received more than 40,000 applications for the latest freshman class of about 3,400. Each application goes through a process of holistic review which involves looking at the strength of the high school transcript, the kinds of classes that students take, and how well they perform in those courses. There is also a non-academic review looking at extracurricular activities, essays, and letters of recommendation.

## What does the academic review look at during the admissions process at Stony Brook?
The academic review looks at a student's academic record, especially their grades and performance in the five core academic subjects: English, history, science, math, and foreign language. The review also considers the level of challenge students take on, whether they take basic courses or go above and beyond, and whether there is consistency in their performance. Standardized test scores are also considered, but holistic factors such as essays, recommendations, and activities report are also reviewed to assess a student's character, level of motivation, and fit for the institution.

## Why is the academic fit important in the admissions process?
The academic fit is critical, especially for academically competitive schools like Stony Brook. Admitting a student who is not prepared to be successful is not fair to the student or the institution. The academic fit is assessed through the review of a student's academic record and performance.

## What shifts have been made in the admissions process at Stony Brook with the increase in applications and the test-optional policy?
With the increase in applications and the test-optional policy, Stony Brook has had to adapt its admissions process to accommodate more applications and assess students' qualifications without relying on standardized test scores. The admissions process is data-driven and considers historical data, and the review of academic record and holistic factors is emphasized to assess a student's qualifications. Students are also encouraged to apply to Stony Brook even if they think their qualifications might not be competitive, as they may have a chance without the requirement of standardized test scores.

## What is the advice given to students when selecting schools to apply to?
Students are advised to do research and choose a few target, reach, and safe schools in each category because an increase in applications has made it harder for institutions to determine the seriousness of studentsâ€™ interest in attending.
## How does demonstrated interest play a role in the admissions process?
Demonstrated interest may not play a direct role in the admissions process but it becomes more important in the waitlist process. Students can indicate their interest in a short answer question on their application, send an email to the admissions office, or have their counselor or principal reach out on their behalf. If they are put on the priority waitlist, their chances of being admitted will increase.
## What percentage of applicants requested not to have their test scores used in the process?
More than 50% of the first-year applicant pool did not want to have their test scores used in the process.
## What advice is given regarding submitting SAT or ACT scores?
Students are advised to take the test once in junior year and again in senior year, and if their scores fall within the range published by the school, they should consider submitting them. Students who fall a little short can still opt for test optional.
## What is the average profile of the current freshman class?
The average profile of the current freshman class is not provided.

## What are the middle 50% stats for Stony Brook University's Fall '21 admissions?
The middle 50% on unweighted GPA fell between 92 and 97, and the testing scores for the SAT were 1320 to 1460 and on the ACT were 29 to 33.

## Can a student enhance their application if they fall lower than the middle 50% criteria?
Yes, students can enhance their application by showcasing their unique experiences such as an upward trend in grades, volunteer work, holding a part-time job, or creating a new program in school or outside of school.

## How does not submitting SAT or ACT scores affect merit scholarships or financial aid?
It does not affect merit-based scholarships because they are determined by a student's overall grade point average and their grades in five academic subjects. Need-based financial aid is based on FAFSA information.

## How important are a student's courses in progress and grades in their senior year?
Senior year is just as important as every other high school year. Colleges want to see where students are currently at and whether they are still taking challenging courses. Admission decisions go out typically by early spring, so maintaining senior year's high academic standard is crucial.

## Can you give an example of a college essay that stood out to you?
The most memorable essays are those that tell a unique and personal story. One essay stood out in particular, as the student described their experience as a first-generation college student who had to work various jobs to help support their family. This essay showed resilience and the ability to overcome challenges, which are ideal qualities for a Stony Brook student.

## What is the purpose of the essay in the application process?
The essay is an opportunity for students to share their personal story, who they are, what their interests are, and what influenced them. The essay also demonstrates the students' communication skills and grammatical abilities.

## What should a student include when discussing an influential person in their life?
Students should not only describe the person or role that influenced them, but they should also explain how it changed them, what they learned, and how it shaped their perspective.

## What does the activities report on a student's application tell admissions representatives?
The activities report tells admissions representatives about the student's passions, level of commitment to those passions, and their ability to manage their time. It can also include employment outside of school, which demonstrates the student's ability to multitask.

## Why is it important for student-athletes to make their intentions to play known early in the application process?
Coaches often recruit early in the application process, so it is important for student-athletes to make their interests known early on and follow guidelines and parameters set by the school. Student-athletes should also remember that they are student-athletes, and their academic success is paramount.

## What is the importance of communication between the student and the institution during the college process?
Communication is very important in the college process. At least sharing the level of interest with the institution will be very important to ensure that the student is in the timeline to be considered because coaches are looking to fill up their teams early in the process. So for the student who waits until the end, they may not get a spot on the team. It is important to be early, proactive, and open in the communication stream. 

## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents who are getting ready for the college process?
The first piece of advice is to let the student be the self-advocate and to lead the process. The student should ask questions during the college visit and not let their parents get involved in asking questions that the students should be asking. The second piece of advice is to take a long, hard look at costs. Understand what goes into the cost and if the scholarships are renewable. The third piece of advice is to think outside of the box and don't get caught up with what you think you should be doing or what others are doing. Think about what's best for you and keep an open and clear lens while breathing through the process. 

## What is the importance of visiting campuses during the college process?
Visiting campuses is really important for students and parents because it gives them an opportunity to ask questions of the tour guide. The tour guides are going to be honest and upfront. They're students at the institution. It is important for the students to become their best self-advocate by understanding what are good questions to ask and what are reasonably good answers to the questions that they're asking and to make sure they feel confident.
