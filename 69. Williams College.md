## Who is Lance Ledet?
Lance Ledet is an admissions counselor at Williams College.
## How did Lance end up as an admissions counselor?
As a first-generation college student, Lance received free college advising and was fortunate enough to find out about Williams College which he attended. After graduation, he saw that the admission office was hiring and felt that it was a natural fit. He enjoys being able to spread the word about liberal arts colleges like Williams to students who may not typically hear about them.
## What makes Williams College appealing for students?
Williams College is a small liberal arts school that offers a rigorous academic experience with small class sizes, a student-to-faculty ratio of 7:1, and an average class size of 13. Williams also offers unique academic experiences like a tutorial program where it's just two students and one professor for a whole semester. Williams also sends 26 juniors every year to the Williams Exeter program at Oxford University for a full year of study. Additionally, Williams College is the first and currently only college to have an all-grant initiative for financial aid, which means students will no longer have loans in their financial aid package and won't be expected to work during the semester.
## What can students do outside of the classroom at Williams College?
Williams College is located in the Northwest corner of Massachusetts, about 5 minutes from both Vermont and New York States. Students will often do day trips and weekend getaways to Boston and New York City. On campus, there are over 120 student groups, including acapella groups and sports teams. About 30% of the student body are recruited athletes, and about 20% are involved in club sports.

## What are some of the activities that students can do at Williams College besides clubs and sports games?
Students can enjoy the artsy hub of the Berkshire region with three art museums within 12 minutes of the campus and attend performances of faculty members and artists year-round. The Williamstown Theater Festival is also a popular attraction during the summer, and there are numerous events throughout the year in Williamstown.

## How many applications does Williams College receive each year and how are they evaluated?
Williams College received over 15,000 applications in the past year. Every application is read by two admission counselors simultaneously, and then the admission counselors come together in a committee to make the tough decisions. Each admission counselor is assigned to a variety of different regions and is responsible for answering questions about Williams College from students in that region.

## What are the different ways that a student may apply to Williams College and are there any advantages of applying one way over the others?
Williams College is accepting two forms of applications for the coming application cycle, the common application and the QuestBridge application. Williams College has two decision rounds, regular decision and early decision, with the deadline for early decision in November. There are no explicit benefits of applying early, and students should use their best judgment when deciding whether to apply early or wait until regular decision.

## If a student's academics fall a little lower than the current freshman class average, what can they do to enhance their overall application?
Lance emphasized that every applicant is unique and that the admission process focuses on looking for reasons to include a student rather than exclude them. Students should focus on the aspects of their application that they can change, such as polishing their essay and providing additional information in the additional information section to provide context about their grades or test scores.

## Does Williams College accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes for credit?
Williams College does not accept these classes for credit, but they do consider them in the application review process and use them to determine placement in introductory classes if admitted.

## How does Williams College handle course placement for incoming students, and how many courses must students take before graduation?
Williams College places incoming students in courses based on their previous coursework, but all students are required to take 32 courses before graduation and cannot test out of any.
## How does Williams College consider a student's academic achievements in the admission process and what types of classes are most important?
Williams College considers a student's academic achievements, including IB and AP courses, honors classes, and other advanced level courses. However, if a student's school does not offer these kinds of courses, the admissions office will take that into account.
## Does Williams College use the student's high school GPA on their transcript or calculate their own metrics?
Williams College uses the student's GPA as indicated on their transcript and does not recalculate it.
## What does Williams College look for beyond classroom achievements in a student's activity sheet?
Williams College looks for students who are spending their time outside of the classroom in engaging and productive ways that suit their interests. While leadership roles and club memberships are important, the admissions office also values work and family responsibilities as extracurricular pursuits.
## How does Williams College evaluate college essays, and what qualities make a great essay?
Williams College looks for essays written in an authentic voice and tone, about any topic that is true to the student. The admissions office values essays with unique and authentic treatments over revolutionary topics, and recommends that students avoid using a thesaurus. 
## Are there any specific essay tropes that will not add much to a student's overall application?
The admissions office can easily tell when a student is using a thesaurus, and overly academic essays may not add much value to a student's overall application.

## What advice does the speaker have for students when writing their college essays? 
The speaker advises students not to use big words they don't understand and to write in their own authentic voice. The essay should be centrally about the student and something that uniquely identifies them. 

## Does the speaker offer support for students who may have had an IEP or 504 in high school? 
Yes, the speaker recommends reaching out to the Office of Accessible Education for any kind of assistance or transition support. Small schools like Williams can offer bespoke responses and plans to support students with unique needs. 

## What advice does the speaker have for prospective student athletes in terms of making their intentions to play known? 
The speaker suggests that students who want to be recruited onto a sports team and play at Williams should reach out to the coach for the sport they are interested in playing for. The coach will be able to walk them through the timeline and requirements. For students not interested in being recruited, they can apply without being recruited to a specific team and still try out for varsity or club sports after admission. 

## What are the top three pieces of advice the speaker would give to a student and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
