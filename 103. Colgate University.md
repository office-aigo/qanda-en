## Who is being interviewed on the podcast?
Rob Israel, an admissions counselor at Colgate University.

## What is the focus of the podcast?
To provide insight and advice on every aspect of the college admissions process straight from the people who ultimately make the decisions.

## What is emphasized as being a special aspect of Colgate University?
The community, which is a collaborative effort between students, faculty, and staff where everyone knows your name and makes a personal effort to make you feel welcome.

## What is the recommended way to visit Colgate University?
Signing up for a student-led tour that is unscripted and personalized for each group of prospective students.

## What are some recommended questions to ask during a visit to Colgate University?
Questions that focus on personal aspects of the university such as what the average day is like and what the students are like, as well as questions about specific interests. 

## What should students do to demonstrate their interest in attending Colgate University?
Visiting campus, attending events, reaching out to admissions counselors, and applying through Early Decision are all ways to demonstrate interest.

## Does Colgate University track demonstrated interest as part of their admissions process? 
No, Colgate University does not track demonstrated interest within their admissions process because they believe it is not 100% equitable to do so. However, there are many ways for prospective students to interact with the university, including virtual programming and admissions conversations with current students or alumni. 

## What are the different ways a student may apply to Colgate University, and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other? 
Colgate University accepts the common application, coalition application, and QuestBridge application. The university is an early decision school and has early decision one (November 15 deadline) and early decision two (January 15 deadline). There is also regular decision, which has the same deadline as ED 2. Roughly 50% of the class is enrolled through ED 1 and ED 2, and the other 50% comes through regular decision. There is no benefit to applying one way over the other, but ED applicants tend to know a lot about the university and meet the criteria both academically and personally. 

## Does Colgate University have an honors program, and how are students considered for the program? 
Colgate University does not have a specific honors program that students can apply to. However, within each major, students may have the opportunity to participate in an honors thesis. An Alumni Memorial Scholars Program also exists, where roughly 15-20 students are accepted based on their academic and well-rounded achievements. 

## Is Colgate University test-optional, and what percentage of students that apply and are ultimately admitted did not submit their test scores? 
Yes, Colgate University is test-optional through 2027. Roughly 40% of students apply with test scores, and 60% are admitted either way. Students who do submit their test scores tend to score within Colgate's middle 50%, and the university does not hold a disadvantage to those who do not submit test scores. 

## How does Colgate University determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist, and deny? 
Colgate University is data-driven and focuses on accepting students rather than denying them. However, since the university receives more applications than seat availability, a waitlist process exists, where students who have a chance of being admitted off the waitlist are considered.

## What is the process of predicting the number of students who will enroll at Colgate? 
The admissions team uses their CRM system to predict the number of students who will enroll at Colgate. They focus on the accepts and try to get the right number of students to send the admit letters to. They keep a healthy waitlist and try not to lead students on for months. 

## What are some examples of college essays that left a positive impression on admissions officers and what advice would you give for students getting ready to write their essays? 
Essays that intertwine many of the student's activities into one general theme leave positive impressions. One should focus on a theme that highlights their personality, instead of using complex words. Students should take an open-ended approach to the prompt and talk about themselves. 

## What does Colgate look for in a student's activity sheet beyond the work they completed in the classroom? 
Colgate reads applications holistically and looks for a nice diverse array of activities. They like to see trends with activities such as staying in a club all four years. It's encouraged to include family activities as well. 

## Does Colgate offer any programs for students who may have had an IEP in high school to help ensure their success once they get on campus? 
Colgate has an office of disability services that helps create accommodations for students with specific learning disabilities. Professors work to set students up for success, and the office of residential life provides special housing accommodations for students with disabilities. 

## What can students with disabilities do if they struggle in a class even with accommodations provided? 
Professors are the first resource to go to for help. They hold open office hours and are willing to help students in any way possible, whether it's by leveling the playing field or helping students who've done poorly on a test or quiz.

## What is the significance of living on campus at Colgate University?
Over 90% of the students live on campus during their four years at Colgate University, making it a residential college. The university wants the students to be comfortable both in and outside of the classroom, and to experience a well-rounded college life where academics and residential life are intertwined.

## What are some tips that Rob would give to students and parents during the college admissions process?
Firstly, students and parents should research schools that they are interested in and look at the majors, clubs, and activities. Secondly, students should ask questions, either through regional admissions officers, current students, or informational websites. Finally, the decision should ultimately be left up to the student, and they should choose a campus where they feel comfortable and can make an impact. 

## What is an important aspect that students need to consider during the college admissions process?
Students need to consider whether they can see themselves living on campus for four years without their parents, siblings, or friends. They have to determine whether they feel comfortable being on campus alone, which is an important part of the college admission process.
