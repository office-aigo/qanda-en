## What is the culture like at NYIT, according to Thomas Shea? 
NYIT is a very career-oriented, hands-on focused school that aims to provide students with a skill set that will lead to a successful career. The school has become incredibly good at what it does and provides exposure and experience that not many other schools can provide. The culture is one of "do, make, innovate", which means that students are provided with tools and are encouraged to go outside the box and use those tools for their own ideas. NYIT is also a small to medium-sized school that provides exposure opportunities for students to ask questions and get to know faculty members. Lastly, it is one of the most diverse schools in the country.

## What is life like on campus at NYIT according to Thomas Shea? 
NYIT offers career-oriented clubs, unique identity and cultural-based clubs, and traditional student life opportunities such as student government positions, honor societies, and intramural sports. NYIT is also a smaller to medium-sized school that makes it easy for students to make an impact and have their voice heard. If a student does not see a club they would like to create, they are able to work with Student Life and other students to create it. Lastly, NYIT has a large e-sports gaming team, which is gaining popularity by the year.

NYIT has different application requirements for different programs, so it is important to check what is required for each program. Some programs require the submission of a portfolio.

## Does New York Tech use the student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcript, or do they recalculate it using their own metrics? 
They usually honor the GPA provided by the high school, but there are times where they may need to take the calculation into their own hands.
