## What are the top three pieces of advice to offer for students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Stay organized, do homework on majors and minors, and stay in touch with the schools they are interested in. Demonstrated interest is tracked but won't affect the review process. Little things like introducing themselves via email can make a difference.
