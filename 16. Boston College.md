## Can you tell us about yourself and how you got into the admissions field?
I started in admissions seven years ago, I went to a small private Catholic college called Emanuel College in Boston and was involved in a variety of different areas of higher ed. I found that admission is the perfect mix of being in a desk position but also in a people position.

## What does a typical year look like for a college admissions counselor?
The summer months are used for planning and for hosting visitors on campus as students start their college search process. In the fall, the counselors usually travel to high schools and college fairs to connect with students and counselors to help them figure out what their best next step is. The winter months are great. They hunker down and start reading applications. Typically, in a year at BC, each counselor reads about 1,700 applications throughout November to March. Then in the spring, the counselors work with students in finding their right fit and seeing if that is their institution and help them navigate that process.

## What shifts have you made in your admissions process with the increase in student applications?
BC has maintained a balance, ensuring they are admitting really qualified, wonderful students at early decision, but still leaving space open in the class at regular decision for those wonderful qualified applicants that just aren't ready to make that commitment to BC just yet.

## Does legacy play a role in your decision-making process?
Legacy admission is part of the factors among many in their decision-making process.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class?
For BC, their average GPA is typically in the A, A- grade range in the most challenging curriculum available to them. The middle 50% for their SAT average is about 1410 to 1520, and the ACT is about a 33.

## If a student falls lower than the current freshman class's average, should they still apply?
Yes, if they're very passionate about a school and see themselves there, they should apply. They should go through the process and share their whole story and their whole picture with us.

## If a student chooses not to submit their scores, how does that affect their overall application and are they still considered for merit-based scholarships?
If a student doesn't submit their test scores, it's just simply not a factor they consider. It's not even a blip on the radar. BC does have one merit-based scholarship program and is very predominantly need-based aid as they do meet 100% of demonstrated need. For their merit-based program, you are eligible with or without test scores to be considered.

## Do you conduct on-site interviews with prospective students?
Yes. Prospective students should come with a few questions in their back pocket. They should do some research on the institution beforehand, but they don't have to over-research us and come with a whole thesis statement of why they want to attend the institution.

## Does Boston College offer interviews as part of the admission process?
No, Boston College does not offer interviews as part of the admission process, but admission officer Amy advises students to be authentic in their essays and represent themselves truly.

## Is there a better chance of admission for a student who applies for Early Decision?
Yes, the acceptance rate at Boston College for Early Decision is slightly higher than Regular Decision. However, students should only apply for Early Decision if they are ready to make a commitment to the university.

## What are some examples of college essays that really stood out to you?
The best essays are about life and what has shaped the student. For example, an essay describing a recipe passed down from a grandparent can be insightful. Another example is an essay exploring what the student would do in their last moments if the sun exploded.

## What are you looking for in teacher letters of recommendation?
The teacher recommendation should focus on how the student adapts, interacts with others, and is part of Socratic seminars. A good personal anecdote goes a long way in making a desirable letter of recommendation.

## How important is demonstrated interest in the admission process?
Boston College does not track demonstrated interest, but students are encouraged to engage with the university in events that interest them.

## What do you look for in transcripts and activity sheets?
Boston College admission officers are looking for a cohesive story that showcases the student's passion and interests within the application.

## How do you evaluate varying state assessments?
Although some states have exams like Regents exams, these do not play a significant role in the admission process. Instead, the focus is on the student's four years of coursework in high school and their transcript.

## What other advice would you offer for students and parents starting the college application process?
Students and parents should stay organized and open-minded throughout the application process and learn as much as they can.

## What are some differences that can exist between schools in terms of college admissions policies and requirements?
Every school can have different deadlines, policies, and requirements. Even policies that may sound the same (such as test optional) can have different meanings and implications at each institution. Demonstrated interest can also vary. 

## What is an important aspect of navigating the college admissions process?
Asking questions is important and encouraged. Students should not be nervous when going on tours or interacting with admissions officers. It is important for students to ask meaningful questions and determine if the institution is a good fit for them. 

## What advice does the speaker offer in terms of understanding what can change about an institution and what cannot?

Sticker price can change through financial aid processes, so families should keep realistic expectations and have open conversations. However, the location of the institution is a non-negotiable factor.
