## What makes Duke University so appealing to students?

## Do you attend athletic events at Duke University?

## How does the admissions process work for student athletes at Duke University? 
Recruit student athletes apply using the same application as everyone else, but there is a different timing process for their recruitment. Recruited student athletes are vetted by the admissions office, who have the final say in whether a coach can recruit a student. The student still needs to complete the full application process. 

## Can you walk us through the overall application process at Duke University?
Applicants to Duke University use the Common Application, and Duke also requires its own supplement. The application includes the personal statement, two teacher evaluations, and counselor recommendations. Optional components include interviews and standardized test scores. The admissions process is holistic, taking into account academic grades and rigor, standardized test scores, extracurricular involvement, teacher and counselor evaluations, and personal essays. The admissions office also considers the student's background and potential contributions to the Duke community.

## Can you explain the admissions process at Duke University?
Once an application is complete, it is read from beginning to end by one of a group of admissions officers who work in a particular region. Each application is read from beginning to end by one of our admissions officers. At that point, once an application has been read by one of our staff, at that point, some of the applications, maybe about half of them, go on then for further review. And at that point, they receive two more reads, one from one of the readers that we hire annually, who are generally experienced secondary school or higher education professionals, who often have retired and want to stay in the field, stay in the discipline. And then they're read again and evaluated again fully by one of our regional admissions officers. Some applicants may be discussed in admissions committee, and then some applications are denied provisionally at that point.

## How does Duke University determine the percentage of students to accept, deny, and even wait list in the admissions process?
Duke University works closely with their director of institutional research, who is just so smart and so knowledgeable and so experienced in this. And what happens is near the end of the process, when they've admitted most, but not all of the students, he then does his analytical work and tells Christoph Guttentag of the students they've admitted what the likelihood is of how many of them will actually enroll. It lets them know, do they have more space in the class? Do they have less space in the class? How many more students can they admit? They have an iterative process where they will make some more decisions, he will rerun the data, and then he tells them, "Okay, now you've got X number left, or now you've got Y number left." They like to have a waiting list that is large enough so that regardless of whether they need engineers, humanities students, social scientists, scientists, whether they need students from close by, from overseas, from other parts of the country, regardless of what they need to finish the class, there will be students on the waiting list who are appealing, who are there to be admitted. 

## What qualities do Duke University look for in a student when making admission decisions?
The qualities that Duke University looks for when they're making their decisions tend not to revolve around academics. It tends to be about the sort of things that a student is interested in, the kinds of activities that they are involved in, and more importantly, their ability to have a positive impact on the things that make a difference to them, their ability to make things better, their ability to improve something around them. And what that something is, is up to them. They don't make a judgment about what they should or should not be involved in. What they care about is, do they think well? Do they contribute to the community? Do they contribute to the classroom? Do they make something better? And do they treat other people well?

## What is Duke University's approach to admissions? 
Duke University tends to under-admit slightly to have the opportunity to admit some students from the waiting list. They have a good amount of confidence that they are admitting the right number of students, especially since they have the waiting list available to them if they want to admit some more students. 

## What is the yield percentage generally at Duke University? 
Duke University's overall yield right now is between 55% and 57%. 

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Duke University? 
Most of the applicants graduated in the top 10% of their class. Most of the students who enroll are probably in the top 2% to 3% of their class. The middle 50% of SAT scores of the students admitted was 1520 to 1570, and the middle 50% of ACT scores was 34 to 36.

## What are the different ways a student may apply to Duke University, and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other? 
Duke University has two applications that a student can use: the Common Application and the Coalition Application. There is one binding early decision program with a November 1st deadline. There is one regular decision program with a deadline of January 2nd or 3rd. There is a benefit to applying early decision, as it is a smaller applicant pool, and Duke University typically fills a little under half of the class with students who've applied early decision. 

## Duke University is test-optional, can you share the percentage of students that apply and that are ultimately admitted that did not submit their test scores? 
A little under half (45-48%) of the students who applied this year will end up not submitting testing. Slightly over half of the students that applied will submit standardized test scores. The percentage of students that Duke University admits that have not submitted test scores will be a little lower than that, maybe a third of the students who they admit. 

## What is part of Duke University's rating system? 
Duke University gives five ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 as follows: strength of the student's curriculum within the context of what's typical at their school, academic work, recommendations from the school, extracurricular activities, and the application essay.

## Can you offer any insight on how the application process differs for homeschooled students?
The application process for homeschooled students is the same as for all other students. However, it is valuable for the admissions committee to see how a homeschooled student compares academically to their peers, so if possible, it is helpful to see if the student is taking any advanced classes or standardized tests. 

## How important are students' courses, progress, and grades in their senior year?
Senior year is challenging for students, as it is typically the most academically demanding year as well as the year when students are preparing for college applications. It's important for students to continue on the path they were on in their first years of high school, maintaining good grades and challenging themselves while also not overcommitting themselves and becoming too stressed.

## What advice do you have for prospective students when writing their college essays?
The most successful essays showcase the student's authentic voice and insights, rather than being too focused on using fancy language or overly crafted narratives. The essay should sound good if it were read out loud and not use words that wouldn't be used in normal speaking. 

## What do you look for in teacher letters of recommendation?
The letters of recommendation from teachers and counselors are critical in understanding what kind of student a person is, the energy they bring to their classes, and how they support their fellow classmates. Teachers' letters help the admissions committee understand what kind of person an applicant is in the classroom and what they are adding to their class.

## What qualities do admissions officers look for in teacher and counselor recommendations?
Admissions officers look for qualities that are not always reflected in grades such as insight, curiosity, interesting questions, support, humor, kindness, and impact on the school community. They are interested in examples that highlight these qualities.
## What does Christoph look for in a student's activity sheet?
Christoph looks for students who have a range of interests and care about what they are doing. He is interested in what the students care about, what they have done about it, and if they are making something better.
## What advice does Christoph give to parents who are helping their children with the college admissions process?
Christoph advises parents to set any constraints they may have ahead of time and let their children choose the college they attend. He also encourages parents to take the long view and focus on what their child makes of the opportunities they are given.
## What advice does Christoph give to students who are applying to colleges?
Christoph advises students to have good reasons for why they are applying to each college on their list. He encourages students to make sure every college is one they would be happy to attend and is a good match for them.
