## What is the purpose of the CAP podcast? 
The purpose is to provide insight and advice on every aspect of the college admissions process straight from the people who make the decisions, such as college admissions representatives and other professionals in the field.

## Who is the guest for the episode? 
The guest is Exri Hipp, the Assistant Director at Virginia Tech.

## What are some of the things that make Virginia Tech appealing to students? 
The scenic Blue Ridge Mountains, strong academic programs, D1 athletics, and the sense of family and community on a big campus are some of the things that make Virginia Tech appealing to students.

## Why is visiting campus important for students? 
Visiting campus is important for students to get a feel of the campus, surrounding area, and ask questions to determine if the school is the right fit for them.

## If a student visits Virginia Tech, who can they ask questions to get a better understanding of the campus experience? 
They should ask questions to the tour guide, who will be a student and therefore the true expert of the campus life and experience.

## Does Virginia Tech track demonstrated interest and does it matter if a student demonstrates interest or not? 
Virginia Tech does not track demonstrated interest, but students should still show up to campus visits, college fairs, and ask questions to get to know the school better.

## Does Virginia Tech require a portfolio for certain majors and when should a student apply for admission? 
Virginia Tech admits by major and certain majors such as studio art and architecture require portfolios, but Virginia Tech does not need a portfolio for any of its majors. Early decision and early action are recommended and regular decision should be avoided. Early decision is binding and early action is non-binding, and both have their respective deadlines.

## X.Re. can you share the percentage of students who apply and are ultimately admitted that did not submit their test scores?
About 49% of Virginia Tech's applicants do test optional, and their acceptance rate is nearly identical to the students who are applying with test scores. 

## How do admissions professionals determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist, and deny when schools receive far more applications than seats available?
Admissions professionals use specific criteria for each major, such as courses taken, grades, and answers to short answer questions, to determine acceptance, waitlist, and deny for each applicant. 

## What are admissions professionals looking for when reviewing an applicant's transcript, and does it differ based on the student's intended major?
Admissions professionals understand that high schools may not offer the exact courses needed for a major. They are looking for well-rounded applicants and will consider general subject areas to fulfill major requirements. Admissions professionals review high school profiles to see what courses are offered and what the applicant has taken. 

## How does the application process differ for homeschooled students?
The application process is similar for homeschooled students. Virginia Tech has a specialist, Jane Todd, who works specifically with homeschooled students.

## How does the application process look like for homeschooled students? 
Homeschooled students have to provide transcripts to the admissions office. For those who work with a certain program, they can get their transcripts from their local hub. For those without a hub, they will have to draft up transcripts themselves. 

## What advice would you give to prospective students when it comes to writing essays for college applications? 
Write what you know and what you're interested in. Don't try to write something that you think the admissions team wants to hear. Personalized stories are better as they show passion and authenticity. A small life event is enough to make an interesting essay. Students should also avoid writing about COVID unless it's a personal experience. 

## Aside from academic grades, what else can make a student stand out in the admissions process? 
Short answer questions and extracurricular activities can add value to an application. Short answer questions are a good way to connect with the reviewer, while extracurricular activities show a student's interests and passions. 

## Are there specific extracurricular activities that admissions expect students to participate in based on their majors? 
No, there is no expectation for specific extracurricular activities based on majors. It's up to the student's personal interests and passions.

## What does Virginia Tech look for in applicants, and does the applicant's extracurricular have to align with their major? 
Virginia Tech is looking for students to pursue their interests, and it doesn't have to be related to their major. They want to see students pursuing their passions, and they encourage students to mention their passion to them as they will be looking for them.  
 
## Does Virginia Tech use transcripts to calculate GPAs or do they have their own metrics? 
They do both. They see whatever the student reports; typically it’s the weighted GPA. But they also recalculate it using their own metric after seeing the school profile and what the student is taking, and how they are performing in those classes. Looking for a strong mix of A’s and B’s in upper-level classes is what they are looking for. 
 
## Does Virginia Tech offer programs for students with IEPs, and what resources are available to help ensure their success on campus? 
Yes, they honor IEPs and have the Student Success Center, peer tutoring, and peer mentors. They recommend students take advantage of the resources available to them and they try to ensure any specific needs (for example, extra time on tests) are met. 
 
## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents as they prepare for the college admissions process? 
Ask questions as the process can be very shadowy; check your email as that is the primary method of communication; and relax, as the process is just a few months of your life and life will go on, even if you don’t attend your dream school.
