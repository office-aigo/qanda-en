Michael Splend, an admissions counselor at Providence College.

## How did Michael Splend end up in the position of an admissions counselor?
Michael Splend attended Providence College as a student and worked in admissions related roles. He then worked in sales for a few years before returning to the college admissions field and taking up his current role at Providence College.

## What is it about Providence College that makes it appealing to so many students?
Providence College has a strong sense of community and small class sizes that allow for close relationships with faculty members. The school also has a strong athletics program and is run by the Dominican Friars, giving it a unique perspective on education. The city of Providence is also a great college town with several universities in the area.

## What recent changes are happening at PC?
PC is building new buildings, including a new residence hall, and has redone their dining services on campus. They have also built new schools and athletic facilities.

## What is the student life experience like at PC?
PC has a tight knit community and most students live on campus for the first three years. There's no Greek life, so everyone is included in the big Friar family. On weeknights, there are club meetings and intramural games, and there are plenty of activities to do on weekends, from on-campus events to exploring downtown Providence. Students work hard academically but also have a lot of fun.

## How many applications does Michael review and what is his territory?
Michael reads just over 700 applications and represents upstate New York, Suffolk County, Long Island, and parts of the South.

## What are the different ways a student may apply to PC and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other?
Students may apply through the Common Application and there are four ways to apply with different deadlines: early action, regular decision, early decision one, and early decision two. There's no advantage or special treatment to applying one way or the other, but early action and regular decision have different requirements for what grades are seen and when. Early decision is a binding contract and the best way to let a school know PC is the top choice.

## Can you walk us through the process of how you evaluate applications at Providence College?
The first reader reviews the academic pieces of the applications. The GPA is recalculated and a strength of curriculum score is assigned. Next, the entire application is read and a holistic review is conducted. Every application is given a fair and complete review by at least two counselors. Applications are then reviewed by the entire committee if necessary after the first and second reading. The committee process fills in gaps and talks about students. 

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Providence College?
On an unweighted 4.0 scale, the GPA ranges from 3.65 to 3.7. For strength of curriculum, the score is typically in the high sevens to mid eights (out of 10). The SAT scores are in the range of 660 to 700 for each subject area, and the ACT score is around 31. 

## Is Providence College test-optional?
Yes, Providence College has been test-optional for 17 years. Last year, around 65% of the students applied test-optional and were invited test-optional. This year, around 55% of the students applied test-optional and were admitted test-optional. 

## If a prospective student falls a little below the current freshman class's average, what are some things they can do to enhance their overall application?
The student can focus on an impressive extracurricular resume, completing the optional supplemental essay, and obtaining strong letters of recommendation. The amount of time and effort put into the application is also important, as well as hearing about the student's interest in Providence College personally. Demonstrated interest is not tracked.

## Will email communication between a student and an admission counselor be considered in the application? 
Yes, email exchanges will be seen by admission counselors when reviewing applications. 
## Is demonstrated interest necessary for admission? 
No, it is not required but it can help if the admission decision is on the fence. 
## Does Providence College accept AP, IB or SAT subject test for credit? 
Yes, they do accept them. Students can check the database online to see what scores they need to have their credits accepted. 
## How does Providence College recalculate a student's GPA? 
The college recalculates GPA by taking raw scores from English, math, science, social science, and world language. They will then recalculate an unweighted 4.0 GPA for each student, regardless of what scale the school uses.
## What kind of extracurricular activities are admission counselors looking for? 
Counselors want to see well-rounded students who are involved in multiple activities, whether that's sports, clubs, service organizations, work, or other things important to the student. They want to hear about specific roles and responsibilities students hold, and anything remarkable about their involvement. 
## How important are senior year grades in the admission process? 
The importance of senior year grades depends on when the student applies. If students apply early, admissions counselors won't see their senior year grades. Senior year grades can make a difference if they are weak, and admissions counselors might change their minds. However, if the first three years are strong, senior year grades won't play a big factor.

## What happens if a student's grades dip senior year after enrolling at Providence College?
The school may reach out and ask what happened, but it won't affect the application review. However, if the student applies for regular decision, those grades will be seen and the school will want to see that the student is still on an upward trend academically.
## When do senior year grades become most important for students?
Senior year grades are especially important for students who apply early action and are deferred to regular decision. In this case, the school wants to see if the upward trend in grades will continue for the student.
## What are some examples of college essays that stood out to admission counselors?
Admission counselors love hearing stories in essays and inviting students to Providence College, not their grandparents. Two examples given were an essay about a student's Spotify playlists and an essay about a student getting separated from her family at Disney World and having to navigate her way back on her own.
## Does Providence College offer support for students with IEPs or 504s while on campus? 
Yes, the Student Success Center works on an individual, case-by-case basis to offer academic support for each student.
## What advice do you have for prospective student athletes in terms of making their intentions to play known?
Students who want to play Division I athletics should reach out to coaches and also consider other factors in their college search process. Coaches are typically responsive to receiving outreach and students should also reach out to the Office of Admission for athletic liaisons.
## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?
The top three pieces of advice are to organize your thoughts with a spreadsheet, do research with the help of your college counselor or guidance department, and find a school that fits both academically and personally.

## What is the first thing you should do when looking for colleges?
You should create a long list of schools that have certain things you like about them, with different categories for things that are important to you. For example, geographic location, school size, academic major, and student life.

## What is the second thing you should do when looking for colleges?
Take advantage of any opportunities that are given to you to connect with current students. This will give you the best way to learn about any institution and find out what students like and do not like about the school.

## What is the third thing you should do when looking for colleges?
Keep an open mind and try to avoid biases that come in based on the experiences you've heard from others. Go into every college tour or visit with an open mind.

## What should students do if they are interested in Providence College?
Students who are interested in Providence College should visit the campus, as the college loves to have prospective students and families visit.
