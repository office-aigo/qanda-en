## How do admissions professionals determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist, and deny when they receive far more applications than their seats available?
Admissions professionals use a lot of math, science, and data to determine where schools want to be and how many students will be admitted, factoring in variables such as acceptance rates and the number of schools students apply to. They also strive to keep class sizes small and ensure that first-year students are living with just one other student.

## What advice does Thomas have for prospective students in terms of preparing for and writing their college essay?
The college essay is the one point in the application where the student's voice comes into play, so it is important to write in one's own voice and let one's personality shine through. Prospective students should not write what they think admissions professionals want to hear, but rather write about themselves and what is important to them. There are many ways to approach the essay, from discussing how COVID has impacted their families to funny or abstract approaches, as long as it is genuinely reflective of who they are as individuals.

## What is the advice for students when applying to colleges?
Firstly, do research and engage with admission teams to find a unique college experience. Secondly, ask for help from resources like guidance counselors, financial aid, academic support networks, and friends.
