## What is Pomona College known for?
Pomona College is known for being one of the top liberal arts colleges in the country. It has small classes with an average size of 15, professors who only teach undergraduates, and a personalized and individualized academic experience. Students can explore across the curriculum without being shunted into a narrow set of classes, and there is also a great location, diversity, and a vast range of resources.
## How many applications does Pomona College review each year and how does it evaluate them?
Pomona College evaluates its applications through a Collaborative-Based Evaluation (CBE) system. Each admissions officer manages different territories and reads applications from those areas. They work with a partner and evaluate applications through conversations to reach a conclusion about each applicantâ€™s candidacy. They admit, wait list, or deny candidates based on the evaluations. If someone isn't put into the deny category, then the admissions officer evaluates the application again to decide if the applicant should be brought to committee. Then the committee comes to a group decision about each applicant's candidacy. The number of applications reviewed per year ranges from about 550 to 950.
## Does Pomona College represent a specific region?
Yes, each admissions officer manages different territories, with a focus on states, cities, and countries. They read applications from those areas, and they travel to those areas to get to know schools, counselors, and regions well. For instance, Dr. Brooks, Associate Dean of Admissions at Pomona College, represents Connecticut, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York outside of the five boroughs, as well as Marin County and the far North of California.
