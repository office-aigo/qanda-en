## What is Dr. John Durante's general philosophy or idea of how to approach the college application process? 
Dr. John Durante believes that it is important to be aware of the different parts of the application, understand the purpose of each, and ensure that each piece builds on the next one without repeating information. The transcript lists all the classes taken throughout high school, the activity sheet represents what was done outside the classroom, and essays reflect a student's personality and voice. References should also be carefully selected.

## What is the significance of including work experience in the activity sheet of a college application?
It is important to include work experience in the activity sheet as it may be the reason why a student is not part of many clubs or activities. Admissions representatives advise students to use every part of their application to enhance their overall marketing package.

## What is the importance of the college essay in the application process?
The college essay is where students can showcase their personality and character. Admissions representatives want to learn about who the student is as a person and their interests. It is important not to repeat information from other parts of the application, but rather to use the essay to provide insight into the student's unique qualities and experiences.

## What advice do admissions representatives give about writing a college essay?
Admissions representatives advise students to reflect on their experiences and discuss how they shaped them as a person. For example, if they experienced an injury in a sport, they should explain how they overcame it and how it changed them. Discussing a grandparent or family member is a popular topic, but they should also explain how their experiences shaped them.

## How important are standardized test scores in the college application process?
Test scores are still important and should be prepared for, but many schools are now test-optional. Admissions representatives advise submitting scores if they fall within the middle 50% range of the school's accepted scores, but not submitting them if they do not. The middle 50% range may appear higher than it actually is because only the students who are happy with their scores are submitting them.

## Are more and more schools becoming test optional?
Yes, more and more schools are becoming test optional, but it's important to check if you are applying to certain majors within those schools, as some majors may require test scores. 

## When should families start thinking about the college admissions process?
According to the speaker, families should start thinking about the college admissions process as early as ninth grade of high school, in order to make the best of their high school years. Waiting until junior year can leave students already finished with their transcript. 

## What programs do schools have in place to assist students with the college admissions process?
Many schools have comprehensive guidance approaches with programs for parents from ninth grade through twelfth grade, including financial aid nights, college application nights, and assistance with essays. 

## What advice does the speaker give for requesting letters of recommendation?
The speaker advises students not to be shy when asking a teacher to write a letter of recommendation, and to ask the teacher to specifically speak about a specific incident, rather than just repeating information already on other parts of the application. Anecdotes and personal stories can be especially valuable in recommendation letters.

## Can you tell us some common mistakes or misconceptions students make about the college application process?
One common mistake is that students only consider schools that are highly ranked, rather than finding the right fit for them. Other mistakes include not doing enough research and not visiting campuses.

## What should students consider when choosing a college?
Students should consider whether they want to be close to home or far away, in an urban, suburban, or rural environment, the student-to-faculty ratio, the average class size, social life, and job opportunities.

## What tips can parents give to their children going through the college application process?
Parents can encourage their children to start early, stay organized, and create a separate email address for their college process. It's also important to focus on fit for the student and not worry about where their friends are going or the school's ranking. 

## How can students get valuable information about a college during a visit?
Students should ask questions about majors, minors, research opportunities, internships, job opportunities, as well as the student-to-faculty ratio and average class size. They should also talk to students on campus and explore the surrounding community. It's important for students to create a journal or spreadsheet to keep track of their impressions and preferences. 

## What is the host's podcast, and how can it help college applicants?
The host's podcast provides informative interviews with representatives from different colleges and universities. It can help college applicants gain insight and information on different schools and their philosophies. A list of available schools and the corresponding audio link to each episode is provided on the podcast.

## What is the format of The Cap podcast?

They cover topics like the percentage of students that apply, and essays that really stood out for them.
