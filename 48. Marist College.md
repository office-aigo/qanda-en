## What is the purpose of the CAP podcast?
The purpose of the College Admissions Process (CAP) podcast is to provide insight to students and parents straight from the people who make the decisions in college admissions, regardless of whether they apply to the schools being highlighted.

## Who is the host of the CAP podcast, and who is the guest in this episode?
Dr. John Durante is the host of the CAP podcast, and the guest in this episode is Kelly Neenstadt, the Assistant Director of Admissions at Marist College.

## How did Kelly end up in her position and what does she think sets Marist College apart?
Kelly worked in the Marist College admissions office as a student and applied for a full-time position when she graduated. She thinks the welcoming and open community at Marist, with great students, faculty, and staff, sets it apart. Marist also offers many options for majors and minors, clubs, activities, and study abroad opportunities for students.

## What can Kelly tell us about life on campus outside of the classroom?
Kelly says there are over 80 clubs and organizations, 23 Division I athletic teams, 17 club sports, intramurals, and events hosted by the Student Programming Council, including bingo, outdoor movie nights, yoga, and ski and snowboarding trips. Marist College is located in Poughkeepsie and overlooks the Hudson River.

## How many applications does Kelly review a year and what is the process?
Kelly reviews about 40 applications per day from her region of Long Island, as well as a few other states. Marist College receives over 11,000 applications per year, and each admission counselor reviews about 40 per day. There is a second review in mid-December where the committee makes decisions on some applications.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Marist College?
Most students have between an 87 and a 93 average (3.1 to 3.7 GPA), and the freshman class is made up of students from across the country and about 55 countries. The current freshman class is a bit more competitive than the last in terms of GPA, SAT scores, and honors, AP, and college courses taken.

## What can a prospective student do to enhance their overall application if they fall a little below the current freshman class's average?
Demonstrated interest is important to Marist College and tracked in the application process. This includes visiting campus, attending college fairs or high school visits, and connecting with admission counselors. Kelly recommends that students focus on what they can control, such as grades, transcripts, and extracurricular activities.

## How does leaving out test scores in a test-optional school like Marist College affect merit-based scholarships?
With merit-based scholarships, Marist College focuses on the student's academic achievements (grades and transcripts) but also looks at other factors. If a student doesn't submit SAT scores, their application is reviewed in the same way as one that does, focusing on everything else besides the test scores. Marist reviews students individually and admits about 50% of students with or without SAT scores.

## How does Marist College calculate a student's GPA?
Marist College uses the student's grades from their transcript and takes the GPA directly from their transcript.

## What are some of the things Marist College looks for in a student's activity sheet?
Marist College looks for involvement in extracurricular activities like clubs, community service, part-time jobs, and family responsibilities. The college believes that a good balance between academics and other activities is essential.

## How important are students' grades in senior year, and can they impact admission status in any way?
Marist College takes the final high school transcript from the senior year at the end of the semester and wants students to remain as focused in their senior year as they had been in previous years. Dropping courses can be a red flag, but the college usually considers each case individually.

## Can the Office of Accommodations and Accessibility at Marist College help students with IEPs or those who have had a 504 Plan in high school?
Yes, the Office of Accommodations and Accessibility at Marist College offers general accommodation services to students with IEPs or those who have had a 504 Plan in high school, providing them with support like extra time on tests and taking tests in a different room. The Learning Support Program is a fee-based program for students with designated learning disabilities or ADHD.

## What advice does Kelly have for student-athletes who want to play sports in college?
Kelly advises students to get started as early as possible and reach out to coaches at schools they are interested in. For Marist College, the goredfoxes.com website lists the schedule of all sports events and the roster of each team where students can find and contact assistant coaches to get the ball rolling.

## What are the top three pieces of advice Kelly offers to students and parents who are starting the college admissions process?
Kelly advises students and parents not to stress too much, to visit as many colleges and universities as possible, and to enjoy senior year as much as possible.
