## Who is the guest on the podcast?
The guest on the podcast is Benny Rivera, who is an undergraduate admissions counselor and the honors program liaison at Iona College.

## How did Benny end up in his current position?
Benny initially planned to become a school counselor and attended Iona College for his undergraduate studies. After graduating, he worked for a nonprofit for two years but found his way back to Iona when there happened to be an open position in the admissions office. Benny's mom was the one who pushed him to consider it, knowing that admissions would be a good fit for him.

## What are some of the things happening at Iona College right now?
Iona College is growing in a lot of ways, including expanding to Concordia College's former campus located in Brockville, New York, which will be the home of Iona's new School of Health Science. Additionally, Iona recently announced a partnership with New York Presbyterian Hospital to help make their health science program a premier institution. There are also plans to renovate the space in the center of Iona's campus to make it an outdoor green space. The college is adding more club sports and intramural teams, including a new men's spring lacrosse club team. 

## What makes Iona College appealing to students?
Iona College is located between Long Island and New York City, making it the best of both worlds for students who want access to the city but also want to be close to home. The college is a specific school for students who want to be a big fish in a small pond, and they have over 80 active clubs and organizations. With Iona's growth and expansion, there are many new opportunities for internships and job opportunities, and they have a specific focus on health science.

## What shifts have been made in the admissions process with the increase in student applications?
The school was ahead of the curve in going test optional before the pandemic hit, and even though the pandemic helped to accelerate the shift to test optional, it didn't affect how much the school was doing prior. The school has been slowly building itself to increase applications and reach. Providing more opportunities virtually was the biggest takeaway, particularly for local schools that have students from the West Coast, as it increases reach while also being more convenient for busy families.

## Can you explain the College Assistance Program (CAP) offering for students with learning disabilities?
The CAP program is an optional fee-based program that provides comprehensive support and services for high-achieving students with diagnosed learning disabilities, ADHD, traumatic brain injuries, or just somewhere on the autism spectrum. The program tailors itself to the needs of the students and offers counseling, advocacy training, professional skills-based tutoring, and more. Additionally, the Accessibility Service Office offers similar accommodations, but without the structure of the CAP program.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class in terms of their GPA and any other related data?
The current average GPA is somewhere between 84 to 86, and a good place to be is above an 80 for students interested in Iona. Prior to going test optional, the average SAT was about 1070, and the average ACT was about 23.

## What type of approach does the institution take when evaluating applications?
The institution takes a holistic approach when evaluating applications. They look at the student's current standing, GPA, and test scores, as well as extracurricular activities, community service, and performing arts involvement. They also have an honors program that doesn't require an additional application. They look at essays and recommendations from counselors and teachers to gain a better understanding of the student's personality and interests.

## How important is the essay portion of the application?
The essay portion is considered to be very important as it gives the admissions committee insight into the student's personality and goals. A good essay demonstrates effort and creativity while telling a cohesive story that gives the reader a better understanding of the writer. It is the student's best opportunity to present themselves as an individual to the admissions counselor.

## Do all schools evaluate essays in a similar way?
No, not all schools evaluate essays in the same way. Some schools may have a higher volume of applications and may hire outside readers to assist with evaluations. It is important for students to keep in mind that the essay they submit goes to every school they apply to, and to make sure they proofread their essays for any mentions of other schools. 

## Can you provide an example of an essay that really stood out to you?
One example of an essay that stood out was about a student's family tradition of eating vegetables that she initially hated. The essay related this to a challenge she overcame and the importance of having conversations and not pushing back. The essay was concise and showed effort and creativity. Other essays that have stood out include ones that relate to personal loss and family dynamics.

## What should students be mindful of when applying to colleges?
Students should be careful to ensure that they do not make mistakes in their applications, such as misspelling or applying to the wrong school. Demonstrating interest in the school is also important. 
## What advice would be given to a student who falls below the freshman class average?
It is recommended that the student come to the campus for an interview and show an interest in the school. This will help with the application process. 
## What advice does the speaker give for preparing for a college interview?
The speaker advises students to be themselves and prepare questions for the interviewer.
