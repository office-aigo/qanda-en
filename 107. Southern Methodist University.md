## What does applying early to a school like SMU indicate to the admissions office?
Applying early indicates that the school is one of your top choice schools and that you can see yourself attending. It also helps give a little bit of leniency in terms of academics.

## Besides virtual events, what are other ways students can demonstrate their interest in a school?
Students can shoot an email to their admission counselor or ask questions even if they have taken the time to research the website. Admission counselors are resources for students and can connect them with other students and faculty to help paint a picture of what it's like at the school.

## What are the different ways that students can apply to SMU, and is there any benefit to applying one way over the other?
Students can apply through Early Decision 1 (binding), Early Action, or Regular Decision. Applying through Early Action is recommended because it allows students to indicate that SMU is a top-choice school without the commitment of having to enroll. Early Action also allows for more leniency in terms of grades or other factors. Regular Decision can be more stressful because students won't hear back until early to mid-March.

## Does SMU have an honors program, and how are students considered for it?

## Does SMU accept AP, IB, or SAT subject test scores for credit?
Yes, SMU accepts all three. The school highly encourages students to take advantage of these courses if they are available.
## How does SMU evaluate APs and IBs as part of the admissions process?
SMU takes a close look at APs and IBs, especially if they are available. The school looks at the context of the high school, including if the high school offered any APs, and if so, how many they offer. The school uses this information to see if the student is utilizing the rigor that is made available to them.
## How does SMU treat homeschooled students in the admissions process?
The process for homeschooled students is not entirely different from other students. SMU looks at where they live instead of where they went to high school as part of the admissions process. If possible, the school recommends homeschooled students to take a little bit of rigor by taking two to three additional APs or dual credit courses.
## What advice would you give prospective students when writing their college essays?
When writing college essays, students should focus on telling something about themselves. Application platforms may have their own unique essay prompts, however, the general question that most ask is to tell something about yourself. The essay is often the only opportunity a student has to talk about themselves, and it is important to make it about themselves only.

## What advice does Brenda give to students when writing their essays?
Brenda advises students to write about whatever they feel would best represent them, including their culture and family background. However, she also stresses the importance of reflecting and explaining how that background has made them the person they are today. Ultimately, the essay is about the student and their personal experiences and growth.

## What programs does SMU offer to students with IEPs?
SMU offers resources and departments such as the Disability Accommodation Strategies Office (DASS) and the Alt-Schuler Learning Enhancement Center to help accommodate students with IEPs. These departments can assist students in applying their high school plan to the SMU curriculum and support them socially as well.

## What are Brenda's top three pieces of advice for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?
Brenda's first piece of advice is to start early, but not too early, preferably the summer before senior year. Summer is also a good time to schedule virtual appointments with admission counselors. Her second piece of advice is to do research, ask questions, and don't be afraid to look online. Lastly, Brenda advises keeping an open mind, as everyone's story is different, and they may end up falling in love with a school or taking a different pathway.
