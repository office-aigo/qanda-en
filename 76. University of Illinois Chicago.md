## Why is it important to read the fine print of scholarship programs?
Some schools automatically give scholarships, but at the end of the day, it still costs a lot. Students should read the fine print to know if it's only for a limited time or if the net cost is way more. This helps in making an informed decision based on the best fit, best opportunities, and net cost.
