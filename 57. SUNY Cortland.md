## How did Alex Contento end up in her position as an admissions advisor?
Alex Contento was a student at SUNY Cortland and developed a close relationship with her academic advisor who helped her find an internship opportunity on campus with the HR department. Through the internship, she met the former director of admissions and when an admissions advisor position opened up, both her academic advisor and the former director of admissions had her come in on campus to talk about the job. She was excited about the opportunity, but the pandemic slowed her down a little bit so she wasn't able to start until August. 

## What is the culture like at SUNY Cortland?
According to Alex, the energy on campus is amazing and the faculty and staff are incredible. Students and faculty alike are close-knit and helpful, and the campus community is like a family. 

## What is SUNY Cortland known for academically?
SUNY Cortland is known for its education programs, particularly in physical education, but Alex noted that they have 68 different majors, including business economics, sport management, exercise science, communication studies, cinema study, human services, and healthcare management. 

## What are the facilities like at SUNY Cortland?
SUNY Cortland has recently put $400 million into new and renovated buildings, including the student life center, which is a $56 million project that houses the campus gym, basketball and volleyball courts, free weights, yoga and spin rooms, golf simulators, a rock wall, a pool, hot tubs, and a game room with Xbox, PlayStation, and Wii consoles, arcade games, and pool and ping pong tables.

## What facilities has SUNY Cortland renovated and added recently?
SUNY Cortland has renovated academic buildings, including ones for health, math, business economics, archeology, sociology, and anthropology, and added a new coffee shop that offers locally roasted beans. Additionally, they have renovated their science building, professional studies building, and residence halls, including a new quad-style hall called Dragon Hall.

## How many applications does SUNY Cortland receive and how are they reviewed?
SUNY Cortland received over 12,000 applications this year. Each admissions counselor reads a few thousand applications, but they are divided alphabetically, not by territory. A committee reviews each application, and at least two people evaluate each application before a final decision is made. SUNY Cortland accepts applications through the Common App and SUNY App, and they primarily look at a student's transcript, courses taken, and GPA, as well as information provided on the application such as essay and extracurricular activities. They do not look at SAT or ACT scores at least until 2024.

## What is the average GPA for incoming freshmen and what is the admissions team looking for in an application?
The average GPA for incoming freshmen is around 87 to 93, but SUNY Cortland is looking for solid B students. They primarily focus on a student's coursework, including four years of English and Social Studies, three years of Math and Science at the Regents level, and three years of foreign language. Any extracurricular involvement can also help a student's application.

## If a prospective student falls below the average GPA, what can they do to enhance their application?
If a student's GPA is lower than average, SUNY Cortland recommends taking challenging courses such as AP, college level, or IB classes, or showing improvement over time with an upward trend in academics. GPA is not the only focus for admissions, and SUNY Cortland also takes into consideration the courses taken and extracurricular involvement.

## How does SUNY Cortland calculate a student's GPA?
SUNY Cortland primarily looks at a student's unweighted and weighted GPA on their transcript but may hand calculate it using their core subjects (English, science, math, social studies) to ensure accuracy since different schools may weight classes differently.

## Does Cortland accept AP, IB or SAT subject scores for credit? 
Yes, Cortland does accept AP, IB, and college level course scores. They will accept any college-level courses with a C- or higher, three or better for any AP exam, and four or better for IB. Students can check the transfer equivalency chart on the website. 

## What are some extracurriculars that Cortland looks for other than classroom work? 
Cortland looks for students who are well-rounded and can balance their academics and extracurriculars. They look for involvement in athletics, student clubs, volunteer work, and other activities outside of the classroom. 

## How important are senior year grades and what should students do to keep their grades up? 
Senior year grades are important, and students should continue to push themselves by taking challenging classes. Mid-year grades may be requested before making a final admission decision, so it's important to keep grades up throughout the year. 

## What are the qualities of a good college essay according to Cortland? 
The essay should showcase a student's personality and outside interests rather than just their academics. Good topics include sports, childhood trauma, struggles with mental health, and anything that has shaped who they are today. 

## Does Cortland offer support for students with disabilities? 
Yes, they have a disability resource office on campus that works with students to ensure they have the needed accommodations to be successful. Additionally, academic support services are available for all students, including free weekly peer tutoring and TA help. 

## What advice does Cortland have for high school athletes? 
Prospective student-athletes should research the school and attend prospect camps if available. They should also email the coaches expressing interest and stay in touch throughout the admissions process. 

## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process according to Cortland? 
Cortland recommends visiting the campus, researching schools thoroughly, and being well-rounded with extracurricular activities and academics.

## Why is it important for students to visit campus before making a decision?
It is important for students to visit campus before making a decision because sometimes the school may look perfect on paper but the environment or atmosphere may not feel right for them. On the other hand, a campus that they were not sure about may end up being perfect for them after visiting and experiencing the energy and the people. 

## When should students apply for college? 
Students should apply for college as early as possible. For example, if a college has an early action process, the application should be submitted by November 15th. However, applications should be submitted before December, as classes fill up quickly. 

## Why is it important to apply early?
It is important to apply early because classes fill up quickly. For example, SUNY Cortland received over 12,000 applications this year and ran out of space by February, so a waitlist had to be used for admission. Additionally, students who receive their acceptance letters early have time to come visit campus, attend open houses or other events to see if the school is the right fit for them before the deposit deadline. 

## How do students benefit from developing close relationships with faculty, staff, professors, coaches, and peers? 
Developing close relationships with faculty, staff, professors, coaches, and peers can be beneficial because they can open doors for students to opportunities, such as internships or even jobs. Additionally, meeting people from different backgrounds and cultures can enrich students' lives and provide important networking opportunities. 

## How does the college admissions process sometimes depend on who a student knows?
The college admissions process may sometimes depend on who a student knows because having connections can provide opportunities for students. For instance, Alex was able to obtain a full-time job on campus because she knew many people who worked in that department. Furthermore, developing relationships with professors and advisors can also provide students with internship or study abroad opportunities.
