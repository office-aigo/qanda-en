ED is binding, but applying ED does not guarantee admission. It's important to consider the financial and academic implications before applying.

Tulane University is more interested in seeing the rigor of courses in senior year rather than progress reports.

Mid-year grades and progress reports are primarily used if a student has been deferred or wait-listed. 

## What advice does Bailey have for writing the "Why Tulane?" essay?
Bailey recommends telling a specific story about what made students fall in love with Tulane and why they want to be a student there.

Students should also make sure to get their facts right and never mix up the university they are writing about.
