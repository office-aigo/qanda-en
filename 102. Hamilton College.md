## What is the purpose of the College Admissions Process Podcast?
The purpose of the podcast is to introduce college admissions representatives and professionals in the field of college admissions to students and parents so that they may gain insight straight from the people who ultimately make the decisions.

## Who is the guest in the podcast episode?
The guest in the podcast episode is J.D. Ross, who is the Associate Dean of Admissions at Hamilton College.

## What sets Hamilton College apart?
Hamilton College's approach to academics is different from other schools and colleges, as they have an open curriculum, allowing students to pursue their passions and focus on writing in any discipline. Hamilton also provides a strong and close community where 100% of students live on campus. They offer incredible resources for funding and advising, and they have a devoted alumni body.

## Why is campus visit important?
Campus visits are important for students to get a feeling of the campus, its surrounding area, and to determine if the college is the right fit for them.

## What are the areas that students should visit on campus, and what are some questions they should ask?
Students should do both the tour and the information session to get two viewpoints. They should ask tour guides about the day-to-day experience, classes, interaction with faculty, residence halls, sports, clubs, and activities. They should also ask admission officers about resources, educational philosophy, career guidance, majors or concentrations available, and research. It's important to find the community that is the right fit.

## What are some ways to demonstrate interest in Hamilton?
Visiting campus, taking a tour, attending virtual events, seeing Hamilton at a college fair, reaching out to admission officers with questions, keeping track of email after applying are all great ways to show interest in Hamilton.

## Are applications reviewed regionally or by intended major?
At Hamilton, applicants are not reviewed or admitted by intended major. Regionally, every application is reviewed by at least three admission officers responsible for the geographic area of the applicant.

## What are the different ways to apply to Hamilton?
There are two binding early decision plans (early decision 1 and 2) and regular decision plan. Early decision 1 deadline is November 15th, Early decision 2 deadline is the same as the regular decision deadline on January 4th, and regular decision applicants hear back towards the end of March.

## Is submitting test scores required?
No, submitting test scores is a personal choice. A little more than half of the students in the most recent class submitted an SAT or an ACT score with their application. Hamilton knows that an applicant's academic record and grades are more important in the absence of test scores.

## What does JD look for when reviewing an applicant's transcript?
JD looks at a student's high school experience and whether they are taking the most rigorous classes available and how they are filling their time with those courses. JD also looks for students who are staying strong into their senior year.

## What are some examples of college essays that left an impression with JD?
JD looks for essays that will capture him and help him learn more about the person writing the essay. JD mentions an essay where a student wrote about their experience as a small child playing goalie for a street hockey team and how that experience shaped her.

## What advice does JD offer prospective students in terms of what to think about when they're preparing to write their essays?
JD advises students to use their personal essays to tell the admission committee something about themselves and not to focus on someone else. JD encourages students to use resources available on their website, Hamilton.edu/essays.

## What is Hamilton's approach to reviewing the activities that a student may or may not have taken part in?
Hamilton looks for extracurricular activities that show what is important to the student and how they spend their time outside of the classroom. Hamilton values non-academic experiences that are deeply involved in the student's life.

## Does Hamilton offer any programs for students that may have had an IEP while they were in high school?
Hamilton has an office led by a dean for accessibility resources that coordinates individualized accommodations and support services for any student who has a documented need.

## What are JD's top three pieces of advice for students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
JD's top three pieces of advice are to be yourself, start early, and find your resources.

## What is the first piece of advice in approaching college decision process? 
Give yourself and your family time to approach it thoughtfully by starting early. This includes conversations about goals for college between parents and students, financial aid considerations, and researching and planning for the future.

## What is the second piece of advice suggested in college decision-making? 
Don't lock yourself into a decision too early. Be open and flexible because your interests and goals may change over time. Use the materials that colleges send you as a jumping-off point to have discussions with parents and to frame what you want out of your college years.

## What is the last and final piece of advice? 
Relax and take time for yourself, friends, and family. It is important to find a balance in your life so that the college search does not consume every conversation. Additionally, it is important to lean on resources such as guidance counselors, college counselors, friends, and parents for support.

## What does JD suggest about the college decision process?

He also advises students to be open and flexible as their interests and goals may change over time. Lastly, he emphasizes the importance of finding balance in one's life and leaning on resources for support.
