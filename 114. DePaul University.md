## What questions should a prospective student ask when visiting DePaul?
Some of the important questions to ask are about the ways in which faith and spirituality impact the student experience, the reassurance that students don't need to subscribe to any particular religious belief in order to fit in at DePaul, and about Chicago itself depending on where the student is visiting from.

## What resources does DePaul University offer to help freshmen navigate the city of Chicago?
DePaul University offers the Chicago Quarter Program, which is an experiential class that familiarizes students with the city's culture and history. 

## How does DePaul University evaluate a student's academic record, and does it use the student's high school GPA as indicated on the transcript?
DePaul University primarily uses the high school transcript to evaluate a student's academic record. Assuming that a student has completed all four years of high school at the same school and all of their grades for nine through 12 are accounted for on the transcript, DePaul University will typically use the school's weighted GPA that they provide without recalculating. However, if a student has transferred between multiple high schools or if a school uses a non 4.0 GPA scale, DePaul University will do some recalculations to account for their full GPA for grades nine through 11 and convert that to a 4.0 scale so that they can compare it within the school group. 

## What are the different ways a student can apply to DePaul University, and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other?
DePaul University offers a non-binding early action round as well as a regular decision round for most majors. Early action applicants have until November 15th to apply and will hear back from DePaul University by mid-December. Regular decision applicants have until February 1st to apply and will be notified in mid-March. Early action applicants have the opportunity to apply for other institutional and donor-funded scholarships that can stack on top of their academic scholarship. DePaul University also has a different process for theater and music programs, which rely very heavily on the audition component of the application. These programs have their own in-house admissions teams, and students have until December 1st to submit their materials for auditions and prescreens. If a student doesn't make it past the audition round, they can update their application for consideration in another area of DePaul.

## What are the deadlines for early action and regular decision at DePaul University?

## Does DePaul University offer interviews for prospective students?
DePaul University does not typically offer interviews, but their admission staff does offer one-on-one appointments in different territories during their fall and spring travel seasons. They also offer virtual meetings throughout the year.

## What advice would Noah offer to students preparing for an interview?
Noah suggests using the opportunity to clarify any questions and learn more about the university. Students are welcome to bring their parents to these meetings as it can be a helpful resource for everyone involved.

## What kind of college essays make a great impression on admission offices?
Essays that highlight an ordinary topic and explain why it is meaningful to the student can make a great impression. Additionally, writing about advocacy work or something meaningful one can be an inspiring read for admission offices.

## Why did DePaul University decide to make the essay an optional component of the application?
DePaul University wanted to provide students with the flexibility to decide whether or not they wanted to include an essay in their application. Some students may struggle with writing or have many other things on their plate during their senior year, so making it optional is better than making it a barrier to entry.

## What are the top three pieces of advice for prospective students and parents?
1) Remember that regardless of how the admission process plays out, you are still worthy of dignity and have the capacity to make a difference in your own life and the lives of others. 2) College doesn't have to be a perfect experience to be the perfect experience. 3) Focus more on challenging oneself in the classroom and getting good grades than on writing an extraordinary essay, as grades hold more weight in the admission process.

## What does Noah offer as important advice for students during the college search?
Noah offers two pieces of advice for students during the college search. Firstly, it is important to recognize that things may not go according to their initial plan, but it is the meaning that they make from those moments, both good and bad, that really change their lives for the better. Secondly, it is important to pause and take stock of who they are as a person and engage with that throughout their college search by understanding their goals, intentions, what types of educational settings they thrive in and what type of experiences they want to have access to. Answering these questions can be helpful in narrowing their college list or expanding it, and it can also help focus their attention on the things that matter to them most of all.

## What does Noah advise parents during the college admissions process?
Noah advises parents that they are a very important part of their child's ultimate college decision, especially when it comes to financing their education. It is important that the whole family is on board and understands the commitment that they are making to the college of their choice. However, parents should remember that they are not the ones who are applying to college; it's their child. It is important for their child to engage in the college process independently to some level too. While beyond a certain point it can get a bit annoying if parents try to do too much, it's best to let their child be in the driver's seat with the college search and ultimately allow them to say, "This is where I want to go to school."
