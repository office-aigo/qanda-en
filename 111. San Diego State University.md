## Who is Danielle Toglia?
Danielle Toglia is the Regional Admissions and Recruitment Manager at San Diego State University. 

## How did Danielle end up in the admissions position?
Danielle started off in college admissions in residential life and student activities after graduating with a degree in higher education administration. She had wonderful mentorship and found that she loved her job.

## What are some things that students love about San Diego State University?
Students love the weather, the embracing community, and the opportunities for both academic and social growth. San Diego State University has about 200 majors to choose from and is located in a city with easy access to internships, co-ops, service learning, and social events. The combination of being in a city on a traditional campus our size with all the opportunities that come with that location is something that students find appealing.

## What questions should a student ask when visiting San Diego State University?
Students should ask both formal and informal questions during their visit to San Diego State University. They should clarify any information they need and get to know the neighborhood, the area around the school, and what it's like to take advantage of that neighborhood. They should also get to know the campus and its resources, including what it's like to live in a residence hall with other students and to share space with another student.

## What happens once a student's application is submitted?
After a student submits their application to San Diego State University, their application goes through an initial review process. After the initial review, the application is forwarded to the appropriate academic department for a more detailed review. After the academic department has made a decision, the application is then sent to the final review process where decisions are made. The final review process includes a review of the student's academic record, test scores, essay, and other supporting materials.

## What is the deadline for submitting an application to San Diego State University?
The deadline is November 30th, which is a bit earlier than other universities.

## Why is the deadline for San Diego State University so early?
The November 30th deadline allows the university to move through the application pool swiftly so that they can get decisions out in a timely fashion so that those students that do want to come to visit have ample time to schedule a flight and to get to them.

## Does San Diego State University have a rolling out process?
Yes, they have a rolling out process, but it has nothing to do with GPA or requirements, even when the application was submitted. It is just the university moving through the information as swiftly as possible.

## What are the recommended A through G requirements for San Diego State University?
The A through G requirements include all of your academic work, such as English, social sciences, math, lab sciences, language, visual and performing arts, and electives. Students should look to complete these requirements before they apply or while they are applying.

## Does San Diego State University track demonstrated interest?
San Diego State University does not track demonstrated interest in terms of a check mark or making any marks on a student's application, but they encourage students to show interest so that they can build a relationship with the university.

## Does San Diego State University have an honors program and how are students considered for the program?
Yes, San Diego State University has Weber Honors College, which requires a separate application process. Students can apply to the university on November 30th and then have the opportunity to apply slightly later in the academic year to Weber. The decisions are independent.

## What are the opportunities for students interested in Weber at SDSU?
There are small and intimate classroom settings, taught by the same faculty, and no major specific. The Office of Undergraduate Admission at SDSU can be found in podcast show notes, and other links that Danielle wants to share can also be put in the show notes.

## How does SDSU determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist and deny when the number of students applying is far higher than the number of seats available?
Capacity is dictated by the chancellor’s office, and each campus decides how that capacity will affect the student population. SDSU is looking to fill seats “across the majors”, and over the last few years, has opened two regional offices to expand their population. The balance of admitting out-of-state students while still educating Californians as a public institution has been an interesting challenge.

## Does SDSU require a formal letter of recommendation from a school counselor? How does it build relationships with school counselors to help advocate for students?
SDSU does not require a formal letter of recommendation from a school counselor, but building relationships with counselors can be done by visiting counseling offices, sitting on panels, joining podcasts, attending events, and meeting at conferences.

## What are the kinds of things SDSU admission officers look for beyond the classroom on a student's activity sheet?
Beyond the classroom, SDSU looks for student enjoyment and leadership in their activities. Students who participate in work, church or synagogue, part-time jobs during the academic year or in the summer, or activities in the community can enhance their application.

## What services does SDSU offer to ensure students with IEPs continue to be successful on campus?
SDSU’s Office of Ability Services offers anything students feel necessary to help them succeed. The office provides accommodations to allow students to take advantage of services that may help them do well.

## Should students with an IEP mention it during the college application process?
Yes, if a student has an IEP and has forgone a language because it was not part of their high school graduation requirement, they should reach out to the admission office during the application process to ensure that this information is conveyed.

## What are the top three pieces of advice for a student and their parents preparing for the college admissions process?
Firstly, staying organized is crucial to keep track of guidelines and deadlines. Using a family email account or creating an Excel spreadsheet for all college-related information can be helpful. Secondly, visiting colleges multiple times is ideal as it provides a different perspective before and after admission. Lastly, students should not start their search with a specific list of colleges but instead focus on what they enjoy, such as the size of colleges or the location, and consider the cost.

## Why is it important for students to dismiss things they can't control, but control the things they can during the college admissions process?
Students should focus on things they can control, such as showing interest and returning calls or emails, and dismiss things they cannot control. They should also remember that their decision and the university's decision is not tied to their self-worth. This can become a stressor for students, but they need to understand that this is a difficult process for admission officers as well.

## What advice does Danielle have for parents during the college admissions process?
Danielle advises parents to celebrate their child's triumphs and dismiss their difficulties and work together as a team. She also emphasizes that students follow their parents' lead and not stress over the college admissions process as it has nothing to do with their self-worth.
