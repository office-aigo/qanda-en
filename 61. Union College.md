## What are the different ways a student can apply to Union?
Students can apply either early decision, early action, or regular decision. Union is test optional, with the exception of the Accelerate Law Program and the Leadership in Medicine Program.

## What is the process of evaluating applications at Union?
Union has a team-based approach in reviewing applications with a paired reading system. The process involves asking relevant questions and making collective decisions as a committee.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class in terms of GPA and related data?
The incoming first year class for the class of 2026 has an average GPA of about a B plus or an A minus. The middle 50% on the SAT for students that did submit was between a 1300 and a 1470, and a 30 to a 33 on the ACT, again for students that do submit.

## What can a student who falls below the current freshman class's average GPA do to increase their chances of being admitted?
Union looks at each student individually from the lens of their particular high school and their high school experiences. Union recommends an upward trend and students finishing strong, as well as connecting with admissions through an optional interview.

## How can a student better prepare for their interview at Union?
Union recommends that the student treat the interview as a conversation. They are comfortable questions and an exchange of information. Union has some talking points on their webpage to help prepare for the interview.

## What percentage of students submitted test scores for admissions to Union College?
Approximately 60% of students submitted test scores while 40% did not. The reason for this is because Union has accelerated medical and law programs that require test scores. However, the transcript is the most important piece of information for the college.

## Does Union accept AP, IB, or SAT subject test for credit?
Union accepts AP and IB scores for credit but does not accept Subject exams. Each department allocates credits differently, and the advising web page has a table where students can see the matches.

## What does Union look for in a student's extracurricular activities?
Union focuses on commitment and likes to see students dedicated to a few activities over an extended period rather than participating in many activities. Athletic commitments can also count as well as part-time jobs or family responsibilities.

## How important are senior year grades in the admissions process at Union?
Senior year grades are crucial as it is difficult to bounce back from a weak senior year, compared to a weaker sophomore year.

## What kind of essay does Union College favor in the application?
Union College prefers essays where students take the time and effort to personalize and reflect on their application. It is an opportunity for students to maintain a personal account of their storytelling.

## Does Union College offer support for students with IEP or 504 plans?
Yes, Union provides an accommodative service office that provides equal opportunities for students with documented disabilities. Students and families can contact the accommodative service office early in the prospect stage.

## How can prospective student-athletes approach Union College?
Prospective student-athletes must complete an online recruiting questionnaire and follow up with a coach of their potential sport. Admissions deans provide support for liaising with the athletic office and providing pre-reads for coaches.

## What advice does Vernon give to students and their parents who are preparing for the college admissions process?
Vernon gives three pieces of advice. Firstly, take the time to get to know the colleges and universities that you intend to apply to. Secondly, do not be afraid to reach out and ask questions or concerns that you have. Lastly, enjoy the process and make sure that the student leads it. 

## Why does Vernon recommend connecting with the schools that students intend to apply to?
Vernon recommends connecting with the schools that students intend to apply to because some schools require an interview, and other schools track demonstrated interest. By connecting with the school, the student can show their interest and dedication to the school, which can increase their chances of getting accepted. 

## Is it recommended to exclude a school because you assume they don't want to answer your questions?
No, it is not recommended to exclude a school because you assume they don't want to answer your questions. Vernon encourages students and parents to ask any questions or concerns they have because colleges and universities are there to help and support students and their families. 

## What is the final piece of advice that Vernon gives to students and parents?
The final piece of advice that Vernon gives to students and parents is to enjoy the process and let the student lead it. The college search process can be overwhelming, but it can still be fun. The student's college experience is theirs, and they should lead the process.
