## Can you introduce yourself and your soccer journey? 
My dad put a soccer ball in my crib when I was born, and I started playing intramural soccer at three years old. I played for a Syosset soccer club from three to eight years old, then joined Levittown from U10 to U12 and made it to the New York Red Bulls Academy. 
## When were you approached by the coaching staff at St. John's University? 
I was approached during my senior year, mostly through phone calls and emails from the coaching staff. I also attended a few ID camps and showcases where I got to meet and play with some of the players on the team.

## What was the transition like for Aiden from high school to St. John's University?
Due to COVID, Aiden had the opportunity to become closer with his teammates, understand the coaches' philosophy, and get used to schoolwork without having to travel all over the place and get used to the intensity of college soccer. He then made his debut in a game against Georgetown.

## What does a typical day look like for a college student athlete at a Division I school?
Aiden's typical day during the spring semester starts with waking up, grabbing a quick breakfast, going to practice, and then returning to recover for his body. He then attends classes and works on schoolwork before attending more practice in the afternoon. Away games require more travel time and fewer recovery activities, while home games involve more pregame meals and preparation.

Aiden usually goes to the hot and cold tubs and then goes to the treatment room to use boots which help with the lactic acid in his legs. Then he has lunch with his friends and takes a nap for about 30 minutes to an hour. After that, he does homework for about three hours until dinner's ready. 

## If Aiden were to go through the recruitment process again, what would he change?
