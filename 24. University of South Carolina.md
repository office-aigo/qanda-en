## Who is the guest being interviewed in this podcast episode? 
Kate Henchey, an admissions representative with the University of South Carolina is being interviewed in this podcast episode.

## What makes University of South Carolina appealing to students? 
Students are drawn to University of South Carolina by the location, being located in a unique city that is the state capital, with thriving culture, industry, and beautiful parks. The academic programs offered by USC, including over 300 degree paths, over 90 minors, concentrations, and 100 undergraduate majors, along with state-of-the-art research centers, countless student organizations, and study abroad opportunities also attracts students.

## How many applications does the University of South Carolina receive each year? 
The University of South Carolina receives well over 42,000 applications each year.

## What is the process of evaluating applications at the University of South Carolina? 
The most important and first thing that the University of South Carolina looks at on an application is academics. Holistic application review is done, which involves taking a closer look at the academics, essay, and activities of the applicant. The goal is to understand the applicant as an entire person.

## Does one person make the decision on whether a student gets accepted or not?  
No, every application is read and reviewed multiple times. No individual has the power to make the ultimate decision. 

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class in terms of GPA and test scores?  
The GPA is on a slightly weighted scale of 4.1 to 4.7, which is equivalent to a B+ to A- average or high 80s to 90s range on a 100 scale. The university likes to see rigor in a student's transcript, such as honors or AP or college credit classes. The university will be test optional for the class of 2023, but the average out-of-state test profile is a 1250 to 1380 SAT or 28 to 32 ACT. 

## Do you recalculate the student's GPA using your own metrics?  
No, the university considers a student's GPA in context of their own high school and relies on the high school's grading scale and GPA to review the application. 

## Do you use the student's high school GPA as it appears on their transcript?  
Yes, the university looks at the student's transcript in the context of their high school. High schools create a profile that includes important facts and statistics for colleges, such as course offerings and average GPAs. This helps the university understand a student's transcript better and not make assumptions or comparisons that may not be valid.

## What can a prospective student do if they fall below the current freshman class average?
Kate, the admissions counselor, advises students to focus on academics, but also to pay attention to details in their essay and activity section. Students can also submit their application without test scores since the University of South Carolina is test-optional.
## Is there an advantage to applying early action?
Kate suggests that students should reach out to individual colleges as they all have different processes. However, at the University of South Carolina, early action weighs heavier on academics but does not necessarily give students a better chance of being admitted.
## How does not submitting test scores impact merit-based scholarships and financial aid?
Financial aid is based on a family's FAFSA, and the merit scholarships and financial aid are separate. The university will consider all academic information, including courses taken, rigor, grades, and GPA, whether or not test scores are submitted. The university is also fully need-blind.
## How important are a student's courses in progress and grades in senior year?
Kate emphasizes the importance of not letting senioritis impact one's grades or schedule. Colleges want to see that students are still working hard and challenging themselves in their senior year.

## How important is senior year for college admissions?
Senior year is very important for college admissions. Universities usually hold all their applicants to the graduating requirements for the state they are located in, and for South Carolina, it means having at least a fourth year of math and a second year of foreign language. Students who opt for a light course load during senior year may not meet these requirements and could be seen as red flags to the admissions committee. Additionally, senior year grades are checked by universities and acceptance is contingent upon the completion of high school and senior year grades. Therefore, if a student's grades drop significantly, they could lose the chance to attend their chosen university.

## Can you provide examples of college essays that have impressed you?
One student wrote an essay about her dad's green bean casserole, which is a family favorite dish. She drew parallels between her fixation on the dish and her mental health journey, and how both are part of her growth. Another student wrote an essay about the Erie Canal song, a childhood favorite, and how it influenced her appreciation of history and how she grew up. Both essays were unique and showed a personal side of the students, which is what colleges look for in essays. The essay is a chance for a student to show off their personality and convey something new about themselves in addition to grades and extracurricular activities.

## Is there such thing as a bad topic for college essays?
No, as long as the essay is written in a unique way that reflects the unique characteristics of the applicant. It's important to avoid creating a sob story or trying to be funny if it doesn't fit the applicant's personality. The essay should be written for the applicant, not for the readers.
 
## What does the University of South Carolina look for in a student's activity sheet?
The University of South Carolina looks for passion and leadership in an applicant's extracurricular activities. Leadership can be shown in various ways, such as leading stretches during sports or taking care of someone's children. Passion is shown through commitment and involvement in an activity, as well as having breadth and depth in the activities list. It's important to show that the applicant is doing something other than studying and watching TV, and have someone look over the activity sheet if needed. 

## Does the University of South Carolina offer related services for students with an IEP in high school?
Yes, but it's important for students to learn how to be their own self-advocate and seek help from the Student Disability and Resource Center each semester after signing up for classes. The university will require documentation of necessary accommodations and the Resource Center can help with accommodations such as note-taking or extended time on exams.

## What resources are available on campus for students?
Resources available on campus include tutoring services, peer-led study groups, a writing center for help with writing and editing papers, a math lab, and note takers. 

## What advice was given to students and their parents to prepare for the college process?
Stay organized throughout the college application process by creating a wall calendar or digital account. Create a list of non-negotiables, including academic, social, and financial factors, to determine the best fit for a college or university. Students and their families should discuss finances early on to set expectations and look for scholarship opportunities. When in doubt, ask the experts, such as admissions counselors, to receive accurate information. 

## What was emphasized as important when determining financial fit for a college?
Students and their families should discuss finances early on to set realistic expectations and determine the best fit for a college based on what they can afford. This conversation should include how much assistance will be given with college expenses and how much the student will need to take out in loans. 

## What is the purpose of the podcast and how can listeners stay connected?
The purpose of the podcast is to provide resources and insight into the college admissions process. Listeners can stay connected by following the podcast on social media and telling a friend about it.
