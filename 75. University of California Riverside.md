UC Riverside is known for academic rigor and preparing students for their future careers. It has a cool founding in plant biology and agriculture, which has led to booming STEM programs and a number two ranking in entomology in the world. UC Riverside also offers a creative writing major and half of its majors are dedicated to humanities, arts, and social sciences. The flexibility of being undeclared is also available.

## What programs are offered at UCR's School of Business?

## What is the living and learning experience like at UCR?
UCR offers a strong community both inside and outside the classroom. About 75% of freshmen live on campus, and there are 600 clubs and activities for students to get involved in. There are also opportunities for research, internships, and mentorship from faculty.

## How do students demonstrate their interest in UCR?

The Zoom meeting is for students and parents/guardians to ask questions. Other friends interested in the school can also attend. All are welcome.

## What advice does Ashley give for students visiting colleges? 
Students should do what is best for their family from a time, financial, and academic standpoint. Students should come and visit, but also do what feels right for them. 

## What are some areas to visit on campus and what questions should students ask to determine if a school is a good fit for them?
Students should check out the classroom spaces, labs, and traditions on campus. They should also eat the campus food and make time to check out the local town. Students should determine what they need to feel safe, successful, and complete in their four years. Students should also ask pointed questions, make the most of their time, listen to podcasts, and check out dormitories.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at UC Riverside and does it differ for in-state and out-of-state students? 
The average profile is higher than the minimum GPA requirement of 3.0 for California residents and 3.4 for non-residents. For non-resident students, the GPA requirement is higher because not all curriculums are created equal. UC Riverside is competitive for California students with a 3.0 GPA or above and more flexible for non-resident students.

Yes, there is currently space available for non-resident students at UC Riverside with up to $13,500 in automatic scholarship opportunities for those who have a GPA of 3.8 or higher.

## Does UC Riverside use a student's high school GPA as indicated on their transcript or do they recalculate it using their own method?
UC Riverside has their own way of collecting data from students. They have the student self-report their grades by putting them into categories on the application. UC Riverside adds extra honors, AP, and IB points to the GPA. If a student does not have senior year grades, UC Riverside will recalculate the GPA to ensure students are in compliance with cutoffs.

## How important are senior grades for UC Riverside?
Senior grades are important, and students must have a senior hire in all grades in their final year to be in compliance with cut-offs and majors competition. UC Riverside can recalculate the GPA using senior grades.

## What is the importance of staying motivated in challenging classes?
Staying motivated in challenging classes is important because it prepares students for their first year of higher education and helps them become well-prepared for the rigors of UCR.
## What are universities looking for in a student's activity sheet?
Universities are looking for the longevity and quality of an activity, as well as specific interests and skill development in certain areas, to see if the student will gain and give back to the experience and the community.
## How do the University of California's personal insight questions (PIQs) differ from the common app prompts?
The PIQs are matter-of-fact experiences that require students to directly answer the question and not include unnecessary storytelling or creativity. Four PIQ prompts are chosen out of eight, and students should pick the easiest prompts for them to write about.
## What resources and support are available for UCR students?
UCR offers unlimited resources and support for students, including first-year programs, the campaign of four and four, orientation, meetings with advisors, faculty support, and the Career Center, which provides career fairs and industry-specific opportunities in policy, medicine, and local government.

## What kind of organizations recruit at UCR's career fair?
Government organizations, nonprofits, and Amazon, which recruits not only in business but in the tech sector as well.

## What advice does Ashley have for students aspiring to play sports in college?
Students should connect with the coaching staff, send over reels or attend showcases, and try to increase demonstrated interest.

## What are the top three pieces of advice Ashley provides for students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Students and families should breathe and focus on finding the right fit. Students should take ownership of the process by organizing themselves, and students should reach out to admissions professionals as humans, not as scary figures.
