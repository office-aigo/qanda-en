## What is the College Admissions Process Podcast, and what is its purpose?
The College Admissions Process Podcast is a platform to interview college admissions representatives and professionals to provide insight and advice to students and parents about the college admissions process.

## Who is the guest in the podcast episode? 
The guest in the podcast episode is Jarvis Deajus, an admissions counselor at Hunter College in the City University of New York (CUNY) system. 

## What makes Hunter College appealing for so many students to apply and attend? 
Hunter College's affordability, diversity, and range of courses and programs, with tuition only being $7,000 a year, over 15,000 undergraduate students from different backgrounds, and over 70 majors and programs.

## What opportunities are available to students at Hunter College due to its location in Manhattan?
There are many cultural attractions and internships available, such as partnering with media companies and hospitals. Hunter also offers partnerships with other institutions like Cornell and the Bellevue Hospital. Jarvis mentions that the entire island becomes the student's campus, and encourages them to take advantage of the opportunities around them by getting a monthly unlimited MetroCard.

## What is McCauley's Honors College, and what does it offer to students? 
McCauley's Honors College is a scholarship package within CUNY that is available at all senior colleges within CUNY. The scholarship pays full tuition for students, provides a MacBook Pro and a $2,000 stipend for research or studying abroad, as well as guaranteeing the student's first year of housing. The total scholarship is around $40,000.

## How many applications does Hunter College review in a year, and what is the process for evaluating them? 
Hunter College receives around 40,000 applications a year. Jarvis Deajus represents Nassau and Suffolk County and goes to various schools, attends college fairs, and does individual visits. Hunter College uses the student's high school GPA indicated on their transcript, and on the rare occasion that it is out of 4, the college would convert it to a scale of 100. Hunter College is also test-blind, meaning that they do not look at the SAT or ACT scores. They use Regents scores for placement in math, but not for admissions decisions. 

## What is the application process for Hunter College, and is there a benefit to applying in a specific way? 
The main way to apply to Hunter College is through the CUNY application, which can be found on cuny.edu/apply. There is no specific benefit to applying a particular way. 

## When should a student apply to Hunter College, and when can they expect to receive a decision about their acceptance? 
Jarvis Deajus recommends that students apply as soon as their senior year starts due to the high number of applications they receive. The fall application for the upcoming year is typically available by September or October. It is recommended that students apply early.

## What is the importance of submitting applications early?
Submitting applications early is important because there might be a misstep or a transcript might arrive late, and small issues could turn into big problems later. 

## What should students do during the summer to prepare for the application process?
Students should use the summer to complete their essays, finish their activity sheets, and ask teachers who will write letters for them before leaving for the summer.

## How important are students' courses in progress and grades in their senior year?
Schools focus on the first three years, but consistency across the board is preferred in the fourth year.

## What are some examples of college essays that really stuck with colleges during the application process?
The best essays provide insight into what the students may be going through or what stage of life they're at, but essays that are too ambitious or express hubris could negatively affect an application.

## What are colleges looking for in teacher letters of recommendations?
Colleges look for insight into how the student's doing, how they react to adversity, work ethic, and other aspects that might not be reflected in transcripts.

## What are schools looking for in a student's activity sheet?
Schools take a holistic approach to a student's achievements. Students should list any volunteering gigs, clubs, or sports they are involved in. In the case of sports, students who are committed and put in a lot of effort should be listed.

## What advice would Jarvis give to students and parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Reading is fundamental, deadlines are important, and students should be resourceful and use available resources to research each college they're interested in.
