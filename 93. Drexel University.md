It offers over 80 undergraduate majors, over 120 different minors, and a bunch of accelerated degree programs.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Drexel?
The average GPA is 3.8 and the average SAT score is 1309.

## Does Drexel recalculate GPAs?
Yes, Drexel recalculates GPAs to accurately evaluate applications against other students in their pool.

## What is Drexel's approach to reviewing students' applications?
Drexel has a holistic review process and considers everything in a student's application, not just their GPA. Admissions counselors will look at a student's transcript to see if they have strong grades in the classes needed for the major they are applying to, even if their overall GPA is lower. Drexel encourages students to check the prerequisites for their desired major on the school's website to ensure their grades meet the required criteria.

## What are the different ways a student can apply to Drexel, and is there a benefit to applying one way over the other?
Students can apply to Drexel using the Common App or the Coalition App, whichever they prefer. There are also different rounds for applications, including early action, early decision (which is binding), and regular decision. There is no preference for rounds or application types.

## What is Drexel's test-optional policy, and how many students submit test scores?
Drexel is test-optional, and about 50% of applicants choose to apply without test scores. The policy has not shown any appreciable difference in the types of students who are admitted to Drexel programs.

## How can students demonstrate their interest in attending Drexel, and does it factor into admissions decisions?
Students are encouraged to reach out to admissions counselors to express their interest in Drexel or a particular program. While interest is not tracked for most programs, it is highly competitive programs like the BSMD program. Getting to know applicants can be helpful for admissions counselors to have additional context when reviewing their applications.

## How important are seniors' courses in progress and grades in their senior year, and what does Drexel look for when reviewing them?
The importance of seniors' courses and grades depends on the round of application. In the case of early action or early decision, seniors' grades in progress are especially important because mid-year grades aren't available yet. If a student is on the fence for admission, mid-year grades can be a helpful data point to sway a decision. Additionally, mid-year grades can be helpful if a student is missing a prerequisite for their desired major, as they can demonstrate proficiency in that course.

## What can students do if they're unsure about which classes to take?
They can reach out to the admissions office, who can help them navigate which classes they need to take based on their interests and prerequisites.

## What are some good tips for writing a college essay?
Write about something you're interested in and that shows a different side of you. Don't focus on something traumatic or fantastical, but rather something unique about yourself that you're passionate about.

## What should be included on a student's activity sheet?
Anything that showcases how well-rounded you are as a student and what you would contribute to campus life. This could be anything from participating in clubs to helping out at home with younger siblings.

Drexel has a disability resources office and a Drexel Autism Support Program to help ensure the continued success of students with IEPs.

## What advice would you give to student athletes looking to play sports in college?

## What advice does the speaker give for proofreading an essay?
The speaker advises getting some folks to proofread it, but not too many as too many opinions might water down the original intention. 

## What is the job of an admissions counselor?
The job of an admissions counselor is to help prospective students figure out whether a particular school is a good fit for them. They can provide information on programs, connect students with current students for more information, and arrange tours of specific buildings. The job is not to sell the school or harass students into making a particular choice. 

## What is the speaker's overall message?
The speaker's overall message is to give tips for navigating the college admissions process, including proofreading essays, seeking help from admissions counselors, and researching different schools to find a good fit.
