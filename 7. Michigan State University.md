Students should write about what they are passionate about, not a specific story that they think the representative wants to hear.

## What advice does Larry give for students talking to colleges or universities?
Larry advises students to take mental notes of their conversations with colleges or universities, make written notes of each school's environment and see how close it is to what they want. He also suggests keeping more doors open at the beginning and gradually pushing them almost closed but not completely because their preferences can change over time.

## What does Larry suggest for students applying to colleges or universities?
Larry suggests that students should be themselves and not try to be someone else. He advises them to evaluate what they are seeing and let their personality come through in their application, essays, and activities. He also advises them to choose the college or university that matches their preference, such as the climate, location, and distance from home, and not to apply to a school just because their friends are applying there.

## Why does Larry emphasize the importance of being true to oneself throughout the college application process?
Larry emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself because being oneself will help students evaluate what they are seeing better, and their application will be better if it reflects their true personality. Students can also make better decisions for themselves and their families if they are true to themselves. Every student has a different preference, and there is no right or wrong answer, so students should choose the college or university that matches their preference.
