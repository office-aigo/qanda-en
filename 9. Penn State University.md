## Can you introduce yourself as it relates to being a college admissions representative?
Lori Wax is the New York Metro Regional Recruiter for Penn State University. Lori came into college admissions as a second career, having previously worked in broadcasting and becoming passionate about higher education and access.
## What makes Penn State University appealing to students?
Penn State University offers over 275 different majors, many of which combine different interests in unique ways, as well as opportunities for cutting-edge research and over 1,200 different clubs and activities. The university also has a strong sense of family and school spirit among its community, which is further strengthened by the largest alumni network in the world.
## How many applications does Penn State University receive each year and how are they evaluated?
Penn State University received about 120,000 applications this year, with about 90,000 of them being from students putting University Park as their first choice. Lori reads a fraction of these applications, with a team of evaluators considering first and foremost a student's academic record, which includes their GPA, grades in classes, and level of difficulty of classes. While the university has been test optional since the pandemic began, they also consider subject-specific tests as relevant to a student's application, particularly for fields like engineering. Other factors, such as extracurricular activities and essays, are used as tiebreakers between similarly qualified candidates. 
## How does being test optional affect financial aid on the merit side?
Being test optional does not affect financial aid on the merit side. Penn State University evaluates students for merit aid based on what they submit for both admission and scholarships, not on SAT or ACT scores. While submitting strong test scores can benefit a student's application, those with stronger academic records than test scores should not submit them, as the university places greater emphasis on a student's academic record.

## How can you figure out where you fit in a university and what is the best way to navigate admissions? 
The best way to figure out where you fit is to check out any university's middle 50% ranges. Look at the middle 50% ranges, see where you fall as far as your GPA and test scores go. If you're higher up in the GPA range, maybe you don't need to submit your test scores. Another thing to keep in mind is to reach out to admissions counselors who can help guide you. 

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Penn State in terms of their GPA and any other related materials? 
For University Park, the middle 50% GPA range is about a 3.56 to a 3.91. SATs range from 1280 to 1450 and ACT range is from 29 to 33. For the Commonwealth campuses, the GPA range is from 3.06 to 3.65, the SAT range is from 1090 to 1300, and the ACT range is from 23 to 30. 

## What is the 2+2 program at Penn State and how does it work? 
Penn State has 19 other campuses that are called Commonwealth campuses. Applicants are asked to indicate their first choice campus and a second choice campus. Applicants will be evaluated for their first choice campus. If an applicant is not able to be offered admission to their first choice campus, they will then be offered admission to their second choice campus. The 2+2 program guarantees any student who is admitted to one of the Commonwealth campuses the opportunity to transition over to University Park for their second two years to complete their major. 

## What is rolling admission and does Penn State offer it? 
Rolling admission means that students can apply as late as June or July as long as there are available spots. Penn State does offer rolling admission but the chances of getting your first choice campus are decreased the later you apply, even for top students. Penn State does not require an official high school transcript until you have been admitted and accepted your offer. They base admissions decisions on your self-reported academic record, also known as your SRAR. You have to fill out your SRAR in order for your application to be considered complete.

## What information is Penn State looking for in a transcript?
Penn State is looking for all the classes taken and the grades received in years nine through 11. They also want to see the senior year schedule to ensure that the applicant is continuing to challenge themselves. The transcript is required to be considered complete, but the senior year grades are not used in the decision-making process.

## What should an applicant do if they make changes to their classes after submitting the SRAR?
If an applicant makes changes to their classes after submitting the SRAR, they should inform Penn State to ensure their files are up to date. It is generally not a problem unless the change is to a required class for something they are applying to.

## Is Penn State test-optional and what happens if an applicant decides to submit test scores?
Penn State is test-optional, but if an applicant indicates that they will submit test scores, they must ensure that the scores are received by the deadline. If test scores are not received, the application will be considered incomplete.

## Does Penn State conduct on-site interviews with prospective students?
Penn State does not offer evaluative interviews, but they are happy to meet with students through Zoom or phone calls. An interview is a great opportunity for students to show their interest and ask questions they cannot easily find the answers to on the website or other sources.

## What kind of college essays stand out to Penn State admissions officers?
Admissions officers want to get to know the applicant, so essays that present a positive outlook or unique perspective on daily life, experiences, and personal achievements, including passions and interests, will stand out. Essays that repeat what is already on the application are not helpful.

## Do Penn State require teacher letters of recommendation, and what kind of information is helpful in them?
Penn State does not require teacher letters of recommendation but does read them. Any information that gives a different picture of the applicant that is not already in the application is helpful. Teacher recommendations that discuss how a student helps others, persevering through struggles, or connect with the teacher beyond the classroom are good examples. Counselor recommendations can also provide helpful context and explain special circumstances.

## What is the best thing that admission officers can get from seeing a counselor recommendation? 
Admission officers can get a little bit more insight into the student's character and learn something new that they didn't already know from their other things in the application.

## What advice was given to students regarding teacher letters of recommendation? 
Students were advised to provide something new for admission officers to learn, just like teachers should add something new to the total application. 

## How often should a student visit the campus and is it tracked by the admission office? 
The admission office does not track interest, but they do track visits to campus. It is highly recommended that students visit campus, but the admission office understands that it is not always feasible. Students can take advantage of virtual visits and programs to engage with the school.

## How does Penn State evaluate varying state assessments such as the New York State regents exams? 
Only the grades received in the actual class are evaluated and not the exam scores. 

## What scholarship opportunities does Penn State offer for academic achievements and does a student have to apply separately? 
Penn State does not have an abundance of merit scholarships, but they do offer need-based aid and some merit scholarships. There are some scholarship opportunities through different academic colleges, which students have to apply for separately.

## What advice was given to prospective students and their parents who are starting the college application process? 
Students should have fun with the process, narrow down academic and social preferences, keep a spreadsheet to stay organized and aware of different deadlines, and keep an open mind when considering different schools as there are many great schools to choose from.

## What did they talk about in the conversation?
They talked about 20 campuses, rolling admissions, and the importance of keeping track of the different aspects and deadlines of each school that you're applying to.

## Who did Laurie give information to?
Laurie gave information to all the students and parents who were listening to the podcast.

## What did John Durante say at the end of the podcast?
John Durante thanked Laurie for being a guest on the podcast and encouraged listeners to tell a friend and follow the podcast on social media. He also said he looked forward to the next episode.
