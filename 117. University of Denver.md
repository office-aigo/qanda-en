The purpose of the College Admissions Process Podcast is to guide students and parents through the college admissions process by providing insight straight from college admissions representatives and professionals in the field.

## Who is being interviewed in this episode of the podcast?
Todd Reinhart, the Vice Chancellor for Enrollment at the University of Denver, is the guest being interviewed in this episode.

## What are some unique aspects of the University of Denver that make it appealing to students?
The University of Denver is located in a great area, is a medium-sized private school with a combination of small liberal arts college and large public flagship school characteristics and has fantastic academics in various fields such as business, political science, creative writing and engineering. The school also has a high percentage of students that study abroad. Additionally, the school has a mountain campus that is used for workshops and outdoor activities.

## What areas should students visit when visiting campus at the University of Denver?
Students should attend the information session and tour, visit academic buildings, the library and the student union. If possible, students should also spend more time in the surrounding area, such as going to local restaurants, museums and tourist attractions such as Red Rocks Amphitheater and ski resorts.

## What advice does Todd Reinhart give regarding the application process for the University of Denver?
Todd Reinhart mentions that the initial application review process is not done by high school or region, but by the admissions team holistically. The school also has a test optional policy. There are also additional scholarship opportunities for students who submit their application early.

## How many staff members are on Denver University's admissions team? 
There are about 15 full-time staff members and 20 seasonal readers, many of which are former admission counselors. 

## How do seasonal readers evaluate applications and how do they decide which applications to read first? 
While there is a rubric, seasonal readers are given freedom to choose how they evaluate applications, either by state, high school, or in the order that the applications are received. 

## How does Denver University handle an increase in applications and determine how many students to accept, waitlist, or deny? 
Denver University uses both art and science when deciding how many students to accept, waitlist, or deny. They receive over 20,000 applications annually but still have limited resources, such as bed space and a limited number of seats. They use a lot of data, such as student interest and engagement, to predict enrollment targets and revenue targets. 

## What are some ways that students can demonstrate their interest in attending the University of Denver? 
Students can demonstrate their interest in attending the University of Denver by visiting the campus, attending sessions, emailing the admission team with questions, and genuinely engaging with the university. 

## Does legacy play a role in the University of Denver's admissions process? 
Legacy does not necessarily play a formal role in the admissions process. Students are evaluated based on their own merits, regardless of whether or not their family members are alumni. However, individual applications may be reviewed if the student's family members are alumni or have attended the university before.

## How important is family legacy in college admissions? 
Family legacy is not very important in college admissions. While having a connection to the university can give applicants a second look, it does not guarantee admission, and decisions are mainly based on academic merit.

## What is the percentage of students who apply test-optional at the University of Denver? 
About 60% of students applying to the University of Denver do so test-optional, while about 40% submit test scores. However, the admission rate is similar for both groups.

## Will more schools remain test-optional even after the pandemic? 
Yes, test-optional policies are here to stay, and some schools may even transition to test-free policies in the future.

## What advice would Todd give to prospective students preparing to write their essays? 
Todd advises that applicants be genuine and write from their own voice and experiences, rather than trying to write what they think the admissions committee wants to hear. The essay should give voice to the applicant's application and show that they can write at a college level.

## What is expected of students when it comes to the essay portion of college applications?
Colleges are looking for insight into who the student is as a person, not necessarily a perfectly written essay. It is advised that students do not have a coach or professional writer write their essay, and to not write it the night before. They should take their time and get genuine feedback from a parent or friend if needed.

## What kind of activities are admissions officers looking for beyond academics?
Admissions officers do not have a specific set of activities they are looking for, but they want to see that students are doing things they enjoy and are finding ways to contribute to their school or community. A diverse range of activities is preferred to ensure a diverse class of students. 

## How important is it for students to withdraw their applications from other colleges once they commit to attending a particular college?
It is greatly appreciated when students let colleges know they are withdrawing their application once they have committed to attending another college. Withdrawing frees up a spot for another student and shows integrity and responsibility. It is important to withdraw from all other acceptances, not just the ones a student is less interested in attending.

## What kind of services do universities and colleges offer to students with learning disabilities?
Universities and colleges offer disability services for students with documented learning disabilities. These services provide accommodations such as extended time on tests, access to audio books, and note-taking assistance. These services are free and protected by federal law. 

## Can you explain the Learning Effectiveness Program (LEP) offered by the University of Denver?
LEP is a program offered by the University of Denver that provides a personal academic coach to help students with executive functioning. The program helps students stay organized, meet deadlines, and develop a calendar for assignments. LEP also provides tutors in a variety of subjects and the cost is an extra fee on top of regular tuition.

## What advice does Todd offer for students and parents navigating the college admissions process?
Todd offers three pieces of advice. First, enjoy the process and don't stress out because there are many schools to choose from. Second, understand that students are in control of the first two steps of the process, which include deciding where to apply and what classes to take. Third, the final decision of where to enroll is up to the student, and they should choose a school that has more to offer than just a good reputation. Parents should be involved in the decision-making process, but the student should ultimately make the decision.
