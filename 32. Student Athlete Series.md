## Who is Kendall Halpern, and what school did she attend?
Kendall Halpern is a women's lacrosse player at Northwestern University. She attended Syosset High School in New York.
## When did Kendall start playing lacrosse, and what other sports did she play?
Kendall started playing lacrosse in about fourth grade. She also played soccer, basketball, and was a competitive gymnast up until seventh grade.
## When did Kendall realize she had a shot at playing lacrosse in college, and what changed for her?
Kendall realized she had a shot at playing lacrosse in college at a fall tournament during the summer after her eighth grade year when the University of North Carolina coach came to watch her play. Her coaches invested in her development, and she began to compete with the best to grow her development as a player and athlete.
## How was Kendall recruited by the coaching staff from Northwestern University, and what was her overall recruitment process like?
Northwestern University approached Kendall's coaches at a fall tournament on the East Coast, and the communication happened through scheduled phone calls and emails. She had an unofficial visit before her verbal commitment in November of her freshman year of high school, and then had many unofficial visits throughout high school and an official visit during her junior year. Most of the recruiting happened through her club team and her performance at tournaments.
## What helped Kendall get recruited the most, and what advice does she have for potential collegiate athletes?
Kendall believes being a multi-dimensional athlete helped her stand out from others. She advises potential collegiate athletes to consider not just where they are happiest now, but where they will be happiest when they are there, and to pick a great academic institution that will prepare them for what's beyond their sport.

## What factors were important for the speaker in choosing Northwestern University for lacrosse and academics?
The speaker, Kendall, chose Northwestern University for the combination of athletics and academics. She valued the great alumni community and the career opportunities that graduating from the university would bring. From a lacrosse standpoint, she was drawn to the opportunity to compete for a national championship under staff with great success and to play for one of the best coaches in the game. The demographic of the team, with players from different places, also stood out to her.

## What advice would Kendall give to high school student athletes aspiring to play at an elite Division I university?
Kendall advises student athletes to not be complacent with being great now. They should continue to work hard, even harder, because when they get to the big stage in college, everyone is good and the work for those people never stops. The players who become the best are never satisfied with how great they are. Kendall also suggests that high school athletes trust in the process, prioritize academics, and not let outside sources dictate their confidence and success.

## What was the transition like for Kendall from high school to becoming a student athlete at Northwestern University in lacrosse?
Kendall was nervous being a freshman on such a successful team, especially coming on after COVID where the team lost a season. In college, it does not matter how good you were or how highly ranked as a recruit you had been out of high school. It just matters what you're doing in the present time and how you're competing at practice. She had to show up to practice every day working as hard as she could, knowing she had to compete and nothing was going to be handed out to her. Kendall earned a starting spot in defense toward the beginning of the season, but the demands of film, one-on-ones, team, and individual meetings were exponentially higher compared to high school.

## What does a typical day look like for a college student athlete at a Division I school?
A typical day for a college student athlete at Northwestern University in lacrosse involves waking up early, attending classes, going to practice for about two and a half hours, going to the weight room for about an hour, and then doing recovery, which includes nutrition and sleep. After recovery, athletes hit the library to do their schoolwork. The schedule definitely changes when they have an away game, which means they miss a lot of class. Athletes try to get a lot of their work done before leaving for an away trip and have academic advisors to help balance and guide their scheduling needs.

## What pieces of advice would Kendall give to a parent and student athlete aspiring to go through the recruitment process?
Kendall suggests that everything happens for a reason, build off your failures, and attend a school that is investing in you not just as an athlete but as a person. It's important to keep your options open and explore different schools and programs before making a decision.
