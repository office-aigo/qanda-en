## What makes Manhattan College appealing?
Manhattan College is located in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, which provides students with a full, vibrant, green college campus while still being in the heart of New York City. The school's five unique schools of study, including the School of Engineering and O'Malley School of Business, also make it appealing to students.

## How many applications does Manhattan College review each year?
Manhattan College anticipates receiving anywhere from 9,000 to 10,000 applications per year.

## How many applications does Manhattan College receive per admission cycle? 
Manhattan College receives about 10,000 applications per admission cycle which is a tall task for a small office. 

## How does Manhattan College evaluate all the applications? 
The applications are read thoroughly by more than one person. A junior counselor does a first read and simplifies the application, then a senior team member cross-checks things for thorough and precise reads. Finally, there is a small committee of about eight people that have a bit of a checks and balances process before making a decision. 

## What is the rolling admissions application? 
Manhattan College operates on a rolling admissions timeline and takes applications from as early as August 1st until May, and sometimes later. The school doesn't hold all of its application decisions to a certain date as some other schools do. 

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Manhattan College? 
Manhattan College likes to see an SAT score range of about 1100 to 1240 for their average 50%, and typically a 22 to 26 composite score for the ACT. Also, an 87 to 93 GPA for the one through 100 point scale, and a 3.2 to 3.8 GPA for the 4.0 scale. 

## What is the percentage of students who apply to Manhattan College without submitting their test scores? 
Manhattan College made its application test optional due to the pandemic and the percentage of students who applied without submitting their scores has increased. However, there is a myth that test optional does not mean test optional.

## What does it mean when Manhattan College is test optional? 

When Manhattan College is test optional, it means that if a student chooses not to submit their test scores, it is one less metric that the school will look at. However, all students will be looked at the same way for admission, financial aid, and scholarship, whether they submit their scores or not.

## Is there a better chance of being admitted if a student applies early decision? 

If a student applies early decision to Manhattan College, they should be in love with the school and 100% committed to attending. Early decision is binding, meaning that if a student is admitted, they are expected to attend and commit by submitting their enrollment deposit. However, early decision does not offer a better chance of being admitted, and it is not recommended for students who are unsure about their college search or for those for whom finances play a primary role in their college selection process.

## How important are a student's courses in progress and grades in their senior year? 

Course selection and senior year grades are extremely important, especially for majors in science and engineering. Academic rigor, including the courses a student selects in their senior year, is measured, and having pre-calculus and physics is important for students looking into engineering. Manhattan College will peek into senior year progress to give students the benefit of the doubt and see how they are progressing in a more normal classroom setting.

## What advice does Nick give about writing college essays? 

Nick advises that nothing is off-limits when writing a college essay, as long as the student's personality and character are conveyed. However, there are themes that are heard frequently, such as game-winning moments or the pandemic, that may not make the student stand out. Nick recommends writing about something the student has a passion for, cares about, and where the reader can see who the student is behind the transcript and application.

## What is an example of a student's essay that stuck with the speaker?
The speaker's favorite essay was a student's reflection on their family traditions on Thanksgiving. Another example was a student who wrote about constructing models out of Popsicle sticks.

## Is demonstrated interest important, and how can students show it?
Demonstrated interest is important, and students can show it by connecting with the school early and often, such as by attending school visits, emailing their admissions counselor, and requesting an interview. There is no need to worry about denying admission based on demonstrated interest, but it can be a factor in recommending acceptance.

## Does the college offer any special programs for students with an IEP in high school, and is there a separate application for them?
The college has resources available for students with an IEP, such as the Specialized Resource Center that provides reasonable accommodations for academic, physical, and emotional needs. However, there are no separate requirements or fees for these programs, and students need to self-advocate for their accommodations upon acceptance.

## What advice does the speaker have for prospective student athletes?
The speaker recommends visiting the athletics website gojaspers.com to get on the radar for recruitment-based sports. The college adds both recruited athletes and walk-ons, and students can be considered for recruitment starting from their junior year.

## What is the website that the speaker mentions and what can you do on it? 
The website is for filling out a prospective student athlete questionnaire. You can submit clips and tape, which can get you discovered by the admissions team and help them get to know more about you if you're interested in playing intercollegiate athletics.

## Are there options for students who may not be D1 quality or looking to play at the D1 level? 
Yes, there are options for students who want to remain fit and active on campus. Over one third of their entire student enrollment participates in at least one intramural sport. Also, they compete in the MAC Conference in eSports, which has grown significantly in recent years.

## What are the three top pieces of advice that the speaker gives for students and parents preparing for the college process? 
The first advice is to visit schools to see where you see yourself and figure out what makes you feel right. The second is to get a calendar or email exclusively for the college search and application process to keep track of important dates and deadlines. The third advice is to take advantage of your resources, such as admissions counselors, to help you make the right decision by May 1st.

## What does the speaker appreciate most about his job as an admissions counselor? 
The speaker's favorite part of the job is working with students, talking to families, and going through the entire process to make sure that students make the right decision and only make one great decision.
