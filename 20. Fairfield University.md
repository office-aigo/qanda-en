## Who is the guest on the podcast today?
Chris Cahill, who is an associate director of undergraduate admissions at Fairfield University.

## How long has Chris been in admissions and how did he end up in this position?
Chris has been in admissions for five admission cycles. He was a business student at Fairfield University and went on to pursue a Master's in Public Administration with a nonprofit track. While in grad school, he met a lot of university employees, including those in the admission office, and was attracted to the job.

## What can Chris tell us about Fairfield University that makes students want to attend?
Chris highlights the physical location of the campus, which is 200 acres in the town of Fairfield within Fairfield County, Southwest Connecticut. The campus has a suburban feel, is close to cities like Stamford and New York City, and is just a few miles from the beach. The facilities on campus are also notable, with many new buildings and infrastructure improvements made in recent years. Finally, Chris notes that students seem happy on campus and this positive atmosphere contributes to the appeal of Fairfield University.

## What are the factors that make Fairfield University stand out to potential students?
The factors that make Fairfield University stand out to potential students include the amount of things students can get involved in, their connection to the faculty, how heard they feel both in and out of the classroom, and the size of the student body. The physical beauty of the campus draws people in, but the connections and networks formed are what make it feel like a much bigger community than it actually is. Alumni pride is also very high, especially in the tri-state area.
 
## What is the Jesuit philosophy, and what can students expect from it once they enroll at Fairfield University?
Jesuit education emphasizes self-reflection, diversity and inclusion, reaching the best version of oneself, and serving others in the community. Fairfield University's Jesuit values drive the campus in a unique way, and students are encouraged to meet people on the margins and be called outside of their particular goals and plans. Academically speaking, Fairfield University's core curriculum includes courses in English, philosophy, religious studies, mathematics and science, regardless of the student's major. This interdisciplinary approach to education is well-balanced and academically rigorous, and also ensures that students are marketable to future employers. There is also an obvious religious and spiritual dimension to campus, with opportunities for students to grow in their faith life regardless of religious background. 

## What can you tell us about the Dolan School of Business at Fairfield University, and how competitive is it to be admitted?
The Dolan School of Business is the largest of the four academic divisions at Fairfield University, and approximately half of the incoming class are Dolan School of Business students. The school is highly regarded and offers a range of programs to suit different interests. As the liaison from the admission office to the Dolan School of Business, the speaker emphasizes the popularity of the school and the competitiveness of admission.

## Does applying as a finance major increase the likelihood of being admitted over applying as an undeclared business major or any major outside the school?

No, there is no difference in the likelihood of being admitted as a finance major versus an undeclared business major or any major outside of the school since the business school has the capacity to support a large number of students. ## Are there any additional essays or applications that need to be filled out for the business school application?

No, there are no additional essays or applications that need to be filled out for the business school application as it is straightforward. ## What is the business core curriculum like and what courses do business students take?

Business students take introductory courses to finance, marketing, and information systems, as well as economics and accounting courses to gain a background in the field. They also take humanities courses as part of the MAGIS core curriculum. ## What is the average GPA for incoming students?

The average GPA for incoming students is around an A-minus or 3.67-3.7. ## Is the university test-optional?

Yes, the university has been test-optional for 12 years and has a middle 50% range for SAT scores of 1240-1370 and an ACT score range of 27-31. However, the score ranges are a guideline and not a cutoff, and the university takes a holistic approach to reviewing applications.

## Does the SAT score represent a student's potential? 
It depends on the student's case. A straight-A student with 10 honors and eight AP courses and a SAT score within the university's range may choose to go test-optional if they feel that the score doesn't represent them well. Meanwhile, a student who has struggled in high school but has shown improvement and has a score within the range may choose to submit it to show their potential beyond their transcript. Ultimately, it's a case-by-case basis and students are encouraged to reach out to their counselor to make the best decision for them.

## Does Fairfield University conduct onsite interviews with prospective students?
Currently, virtual interviews are conducted, but the university used to have onsite interviews before COVID-19. Fairfield University's website is the one-stop-shop for signing up for interviews and tours. While the interview is optional, it's still encouraged and can be evaluative. Students should come prepared with questions, reflect on their high school experience, and research the university. They should look professional, be comfortable talking about themselves and their aspirations, and prepare some concrete examples of what they have done.

## Is there a better chance of admission if a student applies early decision?
Early decision one and early decision two are available, as well as early action and regular decision. The website lays out the details, but there's no significant advantage or disadvantage in applying early decision or any other application option. However, applying early decision indicates a student's commitment to the university and their willingness to attend, which can be a factor in the admission decision.

## What is the distinct feature of early decision? 
The distinct feature of early decision is that it is a binding agreement where the applicant fully commits to the university. The counselor and parent or guardian also need to sign off on this commitment. 

## Does applying early decision increase your chances of admission? 
Technically, yes, it puts you in the best possible position for admission compared to regular decision or early action. However, all applications are still holistically reviewed, and a student's academic preparation is taken into consideration. 

## How does demonstrated interest factor into admissions decisions? 
Demonstrated interest is becoming more important in the admissions process compared to previous years. The number of times a student has visited the campus, whether they interviewed or not, and how many times they reached out to their counselor are becoming more important factors. 

## How can a student demonstrate interest? 
Visiting the campus in person, or virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is highly recommended. Email communication with the admission counselor, introducing yourself and expressing your interest in the university, is also helpful.

## What is the admissions process like and what should students do to show their interest in a college?
The admissions process is a meticulous process that balances data with relationship building. Students who vary in their degree of academic success, extracurricular involvement, and demonstrated interest are considered. It is important for students to show their interest in the college in smaller ways, such as sending an email with updates or questions, but they do not have to email their counselor every week. This process is holistic and GPA or grades are not the only factors considered.
 
## What are some tips for writing a college essay?
When writing a college essay, students should treat it as an opportunity to advocate for themselves and let the university know their story. A well-written, concise essay that is brutally honest and genuine is key. The essay should be positive or challenging and try to get inside the student's mind. It is important not to try too hard to be someone you are not, to be honest and genuine, and to pick a prompt that fits with the story that makes the student look the most unique and stand out. 

## What should a teacher's letter of recommendation include?
Fairfield University requires one letter of recommendation from the student's guidance counselor and encourages one or two more additional letters from a teacher. The recommendation letter should be concise but powerful, with concrete stories or one story that shows the student's personality in their actions and how that teacher was able to understand that student's personality. The letter of recommendation should reveal how the teacher believes the student will thrive in college due to their personality traits.

## What advice does Chris have for teachers writing letters of recommendation for students? 
Chris recommends that teachers connect with students on a human and academic level when writing letters of recommendation. 

## What advice does Chris have for prospective student athletes in terms of making their intentions to play known? 
Fairfield University has an athletics liaison who can help with scholarship opportunities, connecting with coaches, and being recruited. Chris advises students to reach out to the liaison early on in the process, and to make sure to not miss any deadlines. 

## What are Chris's top three pieces of advice for prospective students and parents in terms of the college application process? 
Chris's advice includes keeping a record of college visits, building a relationship with a counselor, and progressing in the level of interest and program participation when visiting campuses or learning virtually.

## What advice does Chris offer for students during the college admissions process?
