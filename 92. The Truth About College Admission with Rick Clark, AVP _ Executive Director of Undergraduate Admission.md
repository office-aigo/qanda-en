## Who is the guest on the podcast, and what is the topic of discussion?
The guest is Rick Clark, the Assistant Vice Provost and Executive Director of Undergraduate Admission at Georgia Tech, and the topic of discussion is the truth about college admission, which is also the title of a book written by Rick.

## How long has Rick been in college admissions and how did he get into the field?
Rick has been in college admissions for over 20 years, having started in boarding admissions after attending the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

## According to Rick, what are some big questions students and families should ask when considering colleges?
Before asking questions about specific colleges, students and families should first consider what the student wants in a college, what type of place the student can thrive in, what the student enjoyed in high school, and why the student wants to go to college. Students should also consider what aspects of college campuses they care about, beyond what admissions officials tend to focus on.

## What is the first thing colleges look at when evaluating a student's application?
The first thing colleges consider is where the student went to high school, as this informs their understanding of the student's academic record so far.

## What factors are considered in the concept of holistic admission?
Holistic admission takes into account the context of the student, including where they are in school, what they have had the opportunity to do, and how they have performed in those opportunities both inside and outside the classroom.

## What factors are considered inside the classroom in holistic admissions?
Inside the classroom, factors such as the classes chosen, trends in academic performance over time, and the ability to push and stretch oneself are taken into account.

## What factors are considered outside the classroom in holistic admissions?
Outside the classroom, the focus is on how a student spends their discretionary time and whether they have had an impact and influence on those around them.

## What are some of the most predictive pieces of student performance in college?
Academic performance in high school and engagement in activities outside the classroom are the most predictive pieces of student performance in college.

## What are institutional needs, and how do they affect the admissions process?
Institutional needs are the goals and objectives of a particular college or university, and they can affect the admissions process by prioritizing certain factors such as geographic region, academic major, or other variables that align with those goals. These priorities may shift from year to year depending on the changing needs of the institution.

## How do colleges determine the number of applicants to accept, deny, or waitlist?
Colleges use predictive models based on historical data to determine their admit rate, taking into account factors such as their bowl size and yield rate. However, the pandemic has disrupted these models, making them less reliable, and leading to more waitlist offers for students.

## What can you tell us about standardized testing and where it's headed?
The test optional movement has grown significantly during the pandemic, and many schools are conducting three to five-year pilots to determine its impact on graduation rates. AI is also emerging as a potential factor in the admissions process, as schools look for new ways to assess students' abilities beyond traditional essays or test scores.

## Can students with solid test scores be guaranteed admission?
No, admission decisions are based on more than just numbers, and schools have a holistic review process that takes other factors into consideration beyond academic scores.

## How does AI affect the future of college admissions?
AI has the potential to shift the college admissions process in the future, such as replacing essays with interviews.

## How do colleges differentiate between high schools that offer different amounts of AP courses in their admissions process?
Colleges take into account the context of the school a student comes from and what opportunities were available to them. They look at what the student did with the opportunities they were given and how they pushed and stretched themselves. Colleges also use historical data from enrolled students who came from that high school and how they performed on campus.

## What is a net price calculator, where can it be found, and how accurate is it?
A net price calculator helps families determine the yearly college costs by deducting the expected family contribution (or SAI) from the cost of attendance. It provides a range of what a family could expect to pay for college. It is available on each college's website and can be found by Googling "net price calculator + college name." The accuracy of the calculator depends on the quality of information a family puts in.

## What is the Common App and how has it helped with the college application process?
The Common App is a platform that allows students to apply to multiple colleges using a single application. It streamlines the application process by providing a consistent set of questions that are asked regardless of which school is being applied to. It also allows for transcripts, essays, and letters of recommendation to be uploaded by teachers or counselors.

## Why do some colleges add supplemental essay questions to their applications?
Colleges add supplemental essay questions to gain more insight into an applicant's background, personality, and potential fit for the school. They want to learn more about what makes the applicant unique and why they would be a good fit for the school's community.

## What information can be gained from the Common App essay, and how is it different from supplementals?
The Common App essay can provide insight into a student's writing abilities and interests. Supplemental essays, on the other hand, can provide insight into what the particular school values and serve as an opportunity for students to demonstrate their interest in the school by answering specific prompts or questions.
 
## What should a student do if they are deferred?
Students who are deferred should follow the specific instructions provided by the school. They may be asked to send in their senior grades or provide updates on their extracurricular activities since their initial application. It is important to read the instructions carefully and only provide the information that is requested. Deferred does not mean denied, but rather an opportunity for the school to see more of the applicant's academic progress and involvement.
 
## What advice would the speaker give to parents and students going through the college admissions process?
The speaker advises parents to seek advice from parents of current college students rather than parents of high school students. He advises students to ask themselves important questions about their interests and values when choosing schools and applying, and to stay true to what they really want. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of controlling what can be controlled, such as the schools to which they apply, and maintaining a positive and open attitude towards the opportunities available.

## What do you control in the college admissions process?
According to the conversation, you control your approach and attitude in the college admissions process.

## What advice was given regarding asking questions during the process?
The conversation emphasized not being bashful to ask big questions during the college admissions process.
