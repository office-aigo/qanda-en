## What are the top three pieces of advice for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?
First, talk to current students at any campus you're considering, as current students are a very appropriate representation of what the campus stands for. Second, apply early so that you have enough time to reflect on where you've been and why it's important to understand where you're trying to go. It also gives you time to fill out personal insight questions and get feedback from counselors. Third, pick your top schools and do your due diligence in research but don't make college your entire identity. You're going to find a good fit no matter where you go and college is about the student, not the other way around.
