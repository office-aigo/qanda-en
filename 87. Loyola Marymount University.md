## What makes Loyola Marymount University attractive to students?
Loyola Marymount University, located in Southern California, has three main components that make it appealing: its Jesuit identity, size, and location. LMU is the only mid-size Catholic Jesuit university in Southern California, which offers worldwide academic prestige along with well-rounded opportunities. Jesuit education provides students with a love of learning and growth opportunities. LMU views education as a path forward for both students and society, and focuses on intellectual curiosity and the education of the whole person by integrating the mind, body, and spirit. The school emphasizes care for the whole person, along with the idea of doing more and improving upon what has already been accomplished. LMU's size is an important attraction, as it is large enough to offer a wide variety of academic and co-curricular opportunities, but small enough to have a sense of community where people genuinely care for each other. Additionally, the school is ranked 16th for happiest students by the Princeton Review. Finally, LMU houses colleges in liberal arts, business administration, communication and fine arts, science and engineering, and a school of film and television, which all provide unique opportunities and experiences for students.

The honors program provides smaller class sizes, unique interdisciplinary curriculum, access to one-on-one mentorship, and research opportunities.
 
## What makes a college essay stand out to an admission counselor?
What makes an essay stand out is the student's writing ability and effective conveyance of their message. The essay should tie back to a lesson learned or an area of growth and should help the application become more human, providing the university with greater insight into who the student is.
 
## What accommodations does LMU provide for students with an IEP or 504 plan?
Accommodation plans from high school do not automatically transfer over to LMU. Students must apply with Disability Support Services, where previous IEP and 504 plans can be reviewed.
