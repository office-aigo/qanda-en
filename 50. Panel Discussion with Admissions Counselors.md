## What should a student be looking for when finding the right college for themselves and ensure that they are the right fit? 
Students should be looking at the academic environment, location, and academics that support their passions when finding the right college for themselves. Additionally, they should consider factors such as class size and support systems they may need. 

## What areas should a student visit when they come to campus and what questions should they be asking to determine if the school is the right fit for them? 
Students should schedule a campus tour, reach out to the college of their interest and eat in a dining hall to immerse themselves in the environment. They should also walk around the town and talk to the current students. They should ask about the student experience, programs, and support systems the college offers.

## What advice do the panelists have for students and families visiting college campuses? 
Panelists advise students and families to ask themselves what they're interested in and to take careful notes during campus visits. They also recommend visiting colleges in person to get a sense of the environment and whether it's a good fit. They suggest interacting with current students and asking questions regarding accessibility of resources that may not be apparent on the website or during virtual information sessions. Finally, they recommend setting up appointments with faculty members or staff in an area of interest. 

## How do admissions professionals determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist, and deny when they receive more applications from deserving candidates than available seats in the institution? 
Admissions professionals determine the number of applicants to accept, waitlist, and deny by taking into consideration the yield rate anticipated for each program. This percentage is carefully calculated annually, taking into account data such as how many people they anticipate will accept their offer. The number of waitlisted students is based on where gaps need to be filled in the class, such as academic majors, regions, and underrepresented identities within the community. 

## How do test optional schools handle the admission of students who do not submit test scores? 
Test optional schools generally admit a high percentage of students who do not submit test scores. At Syracuse University, for example, 60% of the applicant pool did not submit test scores, and nearly 70% of those applicants were still admitted. It's important for students to understand that some specific programs may require test scores, despite the school being test optional. It is always recommended that research should be done to clarify whether a program requires test scores or not.

## How does the percentage of students submitting test scores affect the admissions process for test-optional schools? 
The percentage of students submitting test scores does not affect the test-optional policy of the school. Admissions officers work with the application pool they have at the time. 
## What does Michigan State University consider when reviewing test-optional applications? 
Michigan State University considers a student's academic record and emphasizes that testing is overrated. They also note that test-optional has been around for a long time. 
## What does Adelphi University look for in a student's transcript? 
Adelphi University looks for a student's willingness to challenge themselves and their trend in grades. They also consider extracurricular activities, employment, and family responsibilities. 
## What does Penn State look for in a student's transcript for certain fields of study? 
Penn State focuses on a student's academic record and looks at specific classes that pertain to the student's desired field of study. They also look at grades in math and science for STEM-related fields. 
## What percentage of waitlisted applicants at Vanderbilt University get admitted? 
On average, around 10-12% of Vanderbilt University's first-year class comes from the waitlist. However, the percentage varies year to year based on factors such as how many students accept their spots and the needs of the school's four schools. NYU did not share their statistics on waitlisted students.

## Is the wait list metric a helpful indicator for students and families?
Admissions officers Brianna and Arianna do not find the wait list metric to be a helpful indicator for students and families, as it can vary significantly year to year depending on program and university needs.

## Does NYU accept additional letters of interest or other materials after wait listing?
NYU does not take any additional letters of interest or materials into consideration after wait listing. However, they do give students an opportunity to fill out the wait list response form, which allows them to indicate their continued interest and other programs they may be interested in.

## Does NYU admit students from the wait list for the fall and spring classes?
NYU admits from the wait list for the fall class, but they also enroll a spring class, which comes almost entirely from the wait list. Some programs have a spring class, while not all do. Students who are wait listed at NYU should know that they may also be admitted for one of their spring programs.

## Is it important for students to withdraw their applications from other colleges they were accepted to after committing to one college?
Admissions officer Larry believes it is important for students to cancel their other applications for peace of mind and to focus on moving forward with their chosen college. Admissions officer Arianna anticipates that if a student is matriculating at NYU, they are withdrawing their other active enrollment opportunities from other institutions. However, they do anticipate some students changing their minds and enrolling elsewhere due to melt (when students change their minds). The university uses years of data and modeling based on past experience to help them with decision-making.

## Does Adelphi accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes for credit?
Adelphi does accept up to 30 college credits, which could be a mix of AP, IB, or dual enrollment courses. They have a rubric on their website detailing the scores needed for AP or IB exams and what credits those exams would come in as at Adelphi. For dual enrollment classes, Adelphi requires an official transcript from the university where the classes were taken. Adelphi will accept credit as long as they offer the same course and the student has a grade of C minus or higher.

## Does Vanderbilt accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment classes for credit?
Vanderbilt does accept AP, IB, or dual enrollment credit, but it varies based on the school a student is applying to. Each school has different caveats when it comes to the number of credits that can be brought over and limits to those credits. Vanderbilt emphasizes the four-year residential experience and encourages students to take classes on campus, even if they have taken many credits already. Vanderbilt has different charts in their course catalog and on their website that show the cutoffs for all the different credits they accept. The university registrar handles all transfer credit evaluations.

## When and how often should a student reach out to demonstrate interest in a college or university? What's the right balance?
Lori and Asma agree that every college and university is tracking interest, regardless of whether or not they officially track it. They suggest that students naturally demonstrate their interest in various ways, such as attending virtual or in-person events, asking specific questions that cannot be easily found on the website, or reaching out with updates on their application if waitlisted. However, they caution against bombarding admissions officers with frequent, unimportant emails that may come across as stalking.
## Is there anything else you want to share about your school? What is your top piece of advice for students and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
Jade from Adelphi University advises parents to schedule conversations about college with their students instead of springing them on them randomly. She also suggests that students take advantage of touring opportunities and faculty panels to get a feel for the school. Larry from Michigan State reminds students that the college admissions process is about them and encourages them to be themselves when presenting their application. Ariana from NYU emphasizes the importance of touring campuses.

## What advice does Ariana Yaditu offer for students who are unable to tour campuses?
Ariana Yaditu suggests that if students are unable to tour campuses, they can still explore what a campus might be like by researching colleges and universities in their area that have a similar size, layout, or environment to the schools they are interested in. 

## What is Brianna Grimes' advice for students going through the college admissions process?
Brianna Grimes advises students to be patient during the admissions process and to reach out for guidance if they have any questions. She notes that sending follow-up emails or asking for updates will not speed up the process and that waiting is often inevitable.

## What is Lori Wax's general advice for students going through the college admissions process?
Lori Wax advises students to keep an open mind and enjoy the process. She suggests that students should research different schools, keep track of application deadlines and requirements, and reach out to universities to find out how to increase their chances of getting in.

## What is Asma Mahdi's top piece of advice for students and parents preparing for the college admissions process?
Asma Mahdi advises parents and students to start discussing financial considerations early on in the process. She suggests that families set realistic expectations, research different types of financial aid offered by different schools, and start the process of appealing for more financial aid early.

## What advice does Asma give about asking for more financial aid?
Asma advises that it never hurts to ask for more financial aid. The worst that can happen is they say they can't offer you more money, but you still have your seat in the college and your financial aid package. This way, you can compare all your offerings and decide what's best for you and your family.
