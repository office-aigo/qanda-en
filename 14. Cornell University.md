Ian Shachner went to graduate school at Cornell, specifically for the Industrial and Labor Relations School. He became interested in how people make a place and the culture of a place, which led him to admissions because admissions is kind of the HR of academia.

## What does the host ask Ian Shachner about Cornell University?
The host asks Ian Shachner what it is about Cornell University that makes it so appealing for so many students to want to apply and ultimately spend at least four years there.

## What is Ian Shachner's response to the question about what makes Cornell University so appealing?
Ian Shachner emphasizes that college is really about the individual, but he thinks one of the best things about Cornell is how much different fields are connected and how every curriculum encourages students to use the rest of the school. He promotes encouraging students to plan in time for completely unaffiliated things and to check the general events list to take advantage of all the opportunities Cornell has to offer.

## How many applications does Ian Shachner review in a year, and does he represent a specific region?
Ian Shachner reviews anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 applications a year for the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University. He does not represent a specific region.

## What is the staffing like at the speaker's school, and how is the admission process structured at Cornell University?
The speaker's school has a volume staffing that doesn't require separation into different regions. Cornell University has specific admission committees for each college or school within the university.
## What items do admission committees look at to evaluate candidates at Cornell University?
The first thing the admission committee looks at is the academic transcript, mainly to ensure that the applicant can do the work required for the program they are applying to. SAT or ACT scores can also play a role in the evaluation. Essays, especially the Cornell supplement, carry significant weight in the application and allow applicants to demonstrate their fit for the specific program they are applying to. Activities and references are considered, but the emphasis is on quality rather than quantity.
## What are some things students do to demonstrate interest in Cornell University?
Requesting information and getting on the email list can show demonstrated interest. However, the most important thing is to establish fit and connect to the program by researching the curriculum and showing how it aligns with the applicant's interests and goals. Traveling to the university or attending info sessions is not necessary and can raise equity issues. The supplemental essay should be treated with the same importance as the main essay.

## Is it important to give equal effort to the main essay and supplemental essays?
Yes, it is important to not only put in effort to the main essay but also the supplemental essays. It is not enough to simply copy and paste information from another college or university. It is important to explain why you want to attend that specific university.

## What are some examples of college essays that have stood out to Ian?
The essays that stand out are those where the writer takes the reader into their mind and shows how they think and learn. Essays about overcoming obstacles and failures and showing growth are impressive. Essays about how they learned from a devastating loss or failure are good examples.

## Are there any essays that stand out in a bad way?
Yes, essays that are trying to be funny or use a unique narrative can be bad if they are not well-done. Humor is tough to pull off, and it is important to remember that the essay will be read by a committee, and not everyone may find the humor equally as funny.

## What is important to consider when crafting an application for college or graduate school?
It is important to consider that these applications are like marketing packages, and you have limited space to convey certain messages. It is important to research the program and institution you are applying to and show your fit with that program, rather than just focusing on the end goal. Creativity and humor can work, but it is important to use your team to check and make sure the goals and messages are conveyed effectively.

## What should be considered when selecting teachers for letters of recommendation?
It is important to select teachers based on what messages they can convey about you and your passions. It may not always be the teacher you have a magical bond with, sometimes it can be the class where you had a spark and excelled in a project. Specific stories about a skill or project can make a strong recommendation, rather than just generic praise. It is also important to hint at what you want the teacher to write about to help guide them in writing a strong recommendation. 

## Can you provide an example of a strong letter of recommendation? 
One example was from a student who struggled in science but approached the teacher for help in developing study skills. This showed a growth mindset and dedication to improvement, which made for a compelling recommendation.

## How can a student hint to a teacher what to write in their letter of recommendation?
A student can hint to a teacher by reminding them of a time when they did well in a project and asking them to include that in their letter. Blaming it on the admissions officer also helps, as they encourage students to connect with their teachers in these ways. 

## What should a student avoid focusing on in their application?
A student should avoid focusing too much on what they want to do in the future, as this may come across as insincere and not reflective of college life. 

## What is important when researching a college or university?
It is important to be familiar with the program that the student is applying to, including academic terminology and program structure, as this shows that the student has done thorough research and understands the opportunities available to them. 

## What advice does Ian give about writing an essay?
Ian suggests that it's not about a good use of space, but about the best use of space. Avoid repeating information that the admissions officer already knows, such as the name of the program or school being applied to.

## How important are students' grades and courses in senior year of high school, and can you give an example of why a student's senior year performance made you change your mind regarding their admission status?
Senior year grades are important and matter. Acceptances are contingent upon satisfactory performance in senior year. If the final transcript check shows a significant drop in grades, that could be a problem. It could change the admission status if there was no communication, and it gave us that additional information we needed, especially about a particular field.
## What is the social life like at Cornell University?
Cornell is in a rural area in Ithaca, New York, not a major city like Cambridge or New York City. However, there are a lot of social opportunities in Ithaca, such as festivals, events, and recreational activities like hiking, biking, and skiing. Students are heavily engaged in the community through volunteering and political involvement. The colleges define the town, and students have substantive ways to get involved in social and extracurricular activities.
## What advice would you give to students looking for a social life at college?
It's college, there's some type of distribution. Students should find their people, wherever they go, and they will be there. It is important for students to think about whether the environment is right for them in terms of social life, academic life, and the university itself.

## What are the top three pieces of advice for prospective students and their parents starting the college application process?
Ian suggests that the first piece of advice is for students to know themselves; to be honest with themselves about what they do and don't like and why. The second piece of advice is to know the program: the terms, structure, flexibility, and what the school wants to hear. The last piece of advice is to include someone who does not know you in the essay review process, someone who doesn't care about your feelings at all, to have a harsh editor. 

## Why is knowing yourself important for the college application process?
Knowing yourself is crucial for the college application process because it's about asking yourself honest questions and being able to answer them truthfully. Students need to be clear about what they do and don't like and why, ruling out the possibility that they're pursuing something because of external pressures or expectations rather than their own interests and goals. 

## What is the second piece of advice for the college application process?
The second piece of advice for the college application process is to know the program: the terms, structure, flexibility, and what the school wants to hear. This is all in order to present oneself in the best way possible and make the most of the opportunity. 

## What is the third piece of advice in the college application process?
The third piece of advice is to include a neutral, outside perspective in your essay review process, ideally someone who doesn't know you at all. This is a way to get valuable feedback that may be difficult to obtain from friends and family. This feedback can help improve the overall quality of one's application. 

## How can the advice be helpful for students and parents in the college application process? 
The advice can be helpful for students and parents in the college application process because it focuses on being honest with oneself, knowing what the school is looking for, and getting valuable feedback from an outside perspective. This ensures that students make the most of the application process and present themselves in the best way possible.
