## Who is the host of the Cap?
The host of the Cap is Dr. John Durante.

## Who is the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at Wake Forest University?
Morgan Wurkamp is the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at Wake Forest University.

## How did Morgan Wurkamp end up as an admissions representative?
Morgan Wurkamp attended graduate school at Wake Forest University and realized the importance of story and helping people find a way to tell their story, which is what college admissions is all about.

## What does Wake Forest University offer both inside and outside of the classroom that makes it appealing to students?
Wake Forest University offers small classes, every class taught by a Wake Forest professor, typical class sizes of 20 to 25 students, and opportunities for research and internships as early as freshman year. Outside of the classroom, Wake Forest students are involved in a variety of extracurricular activities and are encouraged to take personal time to focus on their social wellbeing.

## What is the average profile of the current freshman class at Wake Forest University?
For the current admissions cycle, 96% of admitted students were in the top 20% of their class, with 86% in the top 10%. The average ACT score was 33 and the average SAT score was 1470.

## What advice would Morgan Wurkamp give to a student who falls lower than the current freshman class average?
Morgan Wurkamp encourages all students who are interested in Wake Forest University to apply, even if they fall below the average profile of admitted students. Wake Forest has a holistic review process that considers more than just GPA and test scores, so students can demonstrate their potential and advocate for themselves through their personal essay.

## What are the optional supplemental questions offered by Wake Forest?
Wake Forest offers four short answer and/or fill in the blank questions that students can choose to do. They can do one or two of them, and it's a great way to tell the school something different that they might not see in a student's application.

## Why should students take advantage of the optional essay and put effort into it?
The supplemental essay is an opportunity for students to talk about their character, personality, and explain why they may have received a low grade in a course. It's important to put effort into all essays, regardless of whether they are required or optional, as colleges read everything.

## Is Wake Forest test-optional? How many students didn't submit test scores?
Yes, Wake Forest is test-optional. 65% of students in the current cycle did not submit their test scores with their application.

## Should students declare a major on their application?
Students don't need to declare a major on their application, as they cannot officially apply within their major interest until the end of their college sophomore year. It's not a bad thing to see undecided or a specific major, but it's always nice to get a sense of what the student is passionate about academically somewhere within the application.

## Does applying early decision increase a student's chances of admission? What advice would you give to a student considering applying ED? 
There is a slight statistical advantage to applying early decision because the college still has their entire class open and is enrolling roughly half their class ED. Colleges are rewarding decisiveness and want to see that students know where they want to go. If a student is unsure if Wake Forest is their top choice or is concerned about financial aid, they can apply regular decision or consider applying to colleges that meet 100% of their demonstrated financial need. They should also reach out to Wake Forest's financial aid office for help. 

## What are the different ways students can apply to Wake Forest University? 
Wake Forest offers early decision one (rolling), early decision two, and regular decision. They do not offer early action. ED1 applicants can receive a decision in 6-8 weeks while ED2 and regular decision applicants find out around mid-February. 

## How often should a student visit campus and does Wake Forest keep track of visits, whether in person or virtual? 
Wake Forest tracks demonstrated interest, but there are multiple ways to show genuine interest, including attending virtual events. Visiting the campus is not required and other ways of demonstrating interest are equally valuable. 

## Does Wake Forest conduct onsite interviews with prospective students? What advice would you give to students preparing for an interview? 
Wake Forest offers optional interviews, both in-person and virtual. It is truly optional and students should only participate if they feel comfortable. The interview is a way to get to know the student better, and they should share something that might not come up in their application. 

## What are some examples of college essays that really stood out to you? 
The regional dean enjoys reading essays that show the student's personality and make them think they would be great friends with that student. Essays should be unique and offer something about the student that cannot be found elsewhere in their application.

## What are some tips for writing a good college essay?
Essays that resonate are the ones where students realize the need to be both narrative and reflective. The worst thing a student can do is write an essay that is 100% narrative. The essay needs to advocate for the student and show something unique to them. It needs to be a story that only they could share.
 
## What should teachers include in their letters of recommendation for students?
Teachers should include specific examples that speak to something that is not present in the application, such as a student's passion or interest, or their character. Students should not be bashful about asking teachers to include specific examples in their letters of recommendation if something noteworthy occurred.
 
## What are three pieces of advice for students and their parents getting ready to apply to college?
Firstly, students should throw away the idea of the college they have in their minds as the only place where they can be successful and happy. Success is determined by the students, not the college. Secondly, students should self-advocate and lead their own college search process with parents acting as the coach. Lastly, students should approach the process with an open mind and consider colleges they may not have originally considered.

## What advice does the speaker give to students about reaching out to colleges on their list?
The speaker advises students to reach out to the top five colleges on their list and to be the one to ask questions and find out if there is a regional dean. The speaker encourages students to self-advocate and offers to respond to emails in order to get to know them better.

## What does the speaker suggest students should do when thinking about their college applications?
The speaker suggests that students should think about their applications both in the micro and macro sense, not just as separate pieces like a resume or extracurriculars. Students should consider what they want to reveal about themselves and how all the different pieces of their application can come together to create a whole picture of who they are.

## Who is the speaker and what is the podcast about?
The speaker is Morgan O'Neill, and the podcast is called "The Cap," which discusses the college admissions process.
